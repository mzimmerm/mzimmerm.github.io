#+TITLE: What is probability of 3 heads of 4 coin tosses - a review of combinatorics
#+DESCRIPTION: This musing started with a simple question on the Bruce trail walk on 4th line. Actually, it started by talking about probability that mRNA vaccines also cause the VITT blood clots. That was around 2021-04-05, just after CVST was first reported. Much more is known today. This blog is purely about combinatorics, sets, and probabilities.
