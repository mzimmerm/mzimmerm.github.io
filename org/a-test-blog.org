*This post is a test of misc org features, and their Html export. Reviewed till ch 6 included. *

* Things I had to add or modify, to get org and org html export working

Details are inline, here is a summary.

** In export to html, to achieve:

- Nice fontification in Babel code blocks :: Installed from Melpa, package =htmlize=
- Images and links showing correctly :: Created new org mode tags for images and links :
  - *img:* tag to correctly export links to images to html.
  - *post-jekyll:* tag to correctly export links to other org files (in blog) to html. 
- ASCIIMath working :: customize ~org-export-with-sub-superscripts~ to 'do not interpret'. This can also be set per file using option ~#+OPTIONS: ^:nil~.
- Mathjax working :: in ~_includes/header.html~, added ~{ % include mathjax-stuff-new.html % }~ which adds script, src-ed to a online MathJax.js, properly configured as ~TeX-MML-AM_CHTML~.
- Export showing numbered headers, etc :: Modified front matter options generated by ~org2jekyll-create-draft~ from ~H: 2~ to 5, ~num: nil~ to t. Setting ~toc: t~ breaks export - the blog jumps out of Jekyll envelop. Use the following in future blog entries:
  - set # + OPTIONS H:5 num:t tags:nil toc:nil timestamps:t
  - this can be edited in org2jekyll.el source
- For my own ORG/{CSS, JS} files to be used by the Jekyll process, 2 steps are needed :: Remember Jekyll composes (aka messes up) the final HTML. Any added CSS, JS or other things that go to ~<header>~ must be added to ~_includes/header.html~:
  - add *# + HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="my-org-mode.css" />* to the blog org file (this is needed for the css. js to be copied to $BLOG/css)
  - add a link href in *_includes/header.html* ~<link href="{{ site.baseurl }}/css/gongzhitaao-org-mode.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">~ (this is needed because org2jekyll discards the <head> section after the html export, before copying result to _posts, to allow Jekyll composition from _includes/header.html). 
  - Touch to make CSS, JS etc published - If we want a changed or newly added CSS, JS to be copied to $BLOG/css, touch the file - the Org2jekyll publishing is sort of a make which only picks up changed files.

** To achieve my own formatting, added following files in ORG/{CSS, JS} files
 
  - Diobla :: see http://diobla.info/doc/rtags
  - Zhitao Gong  :: https://github.com/gongzhitaao/orgcss
  - My Org Theme :: my-org-mode.css
  - Theme from dakrone :: http://dakrone.github.io/org2.css

Note they need to be touched, and added to  *_includes/header.html* (see above)

*Currently (2017-07-14) I use my own CSS: ~my-org-mode.css~ which borrows from some of the above.*

** Notes 
 
  - Properties on top :: All properties on top of the org file, except ~:header-args dir~, are front matter, generated by ~org2jekyll-create-draft~
  -  ~:header-args dir~ :: I added this to test some babel runs: this defines the default home directory for babel source code. 

* TODO Todos
- [X] use my own css
  - [X] but get better fonts
- [X] where in org2jekyll is the front matter created? can this be changed? - yes, see org2jekyll.el
- [ ] figure out how to export functional index - probably export from org and check result, reconcile with jekyll.

* Basic Babel export to Html

This source:

#+BEGIN_SRC org :exports code
,#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports both
ls -1
,#+END_SRC
#+END_SRC

Results in this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports both
ls -1
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: file-1.txt

Both the code content and the result do show because we set ~:exports both~
* Running ~org2jekyll-create-draft~

Created an empty file with Org front matter like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+STARTUP: showall
#+STARTUP: hidestars
#+OPTIONS: H:2 num:nil tags:nil toc:nil timestamps:t
#+LAYOUT: post
#+AUTHOR: mzimmerm
#+DATE: 2017-04-08 Sat 17:23
#+TITLE: a-test-blog 
#+DESCRIPTION: Testing org2jekyll-create-draft
#+TAGS: org_mode org2jekyll
#+CATEGORIES: categories_required
#+END_SRC

* Name of this file
The file name is *a-test-blog.org* so this is concatenated from title, with no date. 

* Verbatim vs Code markup: = vs ~

- This is a =literal (verbatim) text with link [[a link][http://some.html]]= (surrounded by = ) in text. 

- This is a ~literal code section text with link [[a link][http://some.html]]~  (surrounded by ~ ) in text. 
 
  - So the above, by default, shows that verbatim and code have same font after conversion to html.

* Inline code blocks - src _ language{ .. } and call _ func(arg1=1, arg2=2). Note: no space before {

  - Example 1 - exports code:
    - /text:/   ~src_sh[:exports code]{echo "hello"} plugged in text, inline.~
    - /result:/ src_sh[:exports code]{echo "hello"} plugged in text, inline.

  - Example 2 - exports both
    - /text:/   ~src_sh[:exports both]{echo "hello"} plugged in text, inline.~
    - /result:/ src_sh[:exports both]{echo "hello"} plugged in text, inline.

  - Example 3: - exports results. This is *likely the most common use of inline code blocks*
    - /text:/   ~src_sh[:exports results]{echo "hello"} plugged in text, inline.~
    - /result:/ src_sh[:exports results]{echo "hello"} plugged in text, inline.

  - Example 4 - exports results. As above, showing exports results is default in src_
    -  /text:/ ~src_sh{echo "hello"} plugged in text, inline~
    - /result:/ src_sh{echo "hello"} plugged in text, inline.

  - Example 5: This shows the inside literally as code, so does not call the code
    - /text:/   ~src_sh[:exports code]{ls -l}~ allsurrounded by ~ in text: 
    - /result:/ ~src_sh[:exports code]{ls -l} - ls -l refuses to work, result with newline is not allowed in inline calls~

  - Example 6: Defining function add-in-shell in BEGIN_ SRC 

    - /text:/
      #+BEGIN_SRC 
        ,#+name: add-in-shell
        ,#+BEGIN_SRC sh :var arg1=1 :var arg2=2
        echo arg1 plus arg2 = $(($arg1 + $arg2))
        ,#+END_SRC
      #+END_SRC
    - /result:/ - this displays code, correctly fontified:
      #+name: add-in-shell
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh :var arg1=1 :var arg2=2
      echo arg1 plus arg2 = $(($arg1 + $arg2))
      #+END_SRC

  - Example 7:

    - /text:/   The following files are in home dir ~src_sh{ls -1}~
    - /result:/ The following files are in home dir ~src_sh{ls -1} - ls -l refuses to work, result with newline is not allowed in inline calls. Message: *list results cannot be used*~

  - Example 8: Calling add-in-shell:
    - /text:/   ~call_add-in-shell(arg1=3, arg2=4)~
    - /result:/ call_add-in-shell(arg1=3, arg2=4)

* Three types of lists

There are 3 types of lists in org. This is how they convert to html:

1. /Ordered List = Numbered List/: Shopping list
   1. The Attack of the Clones
   2. Drones
      + Blue 
      + Red
   3. Coffee
2. /Unordered List = Bulleted List/: Favourite Movies, no particular order:
   - Krakatit.
   - The Avatar.
3. /Description List/: No order. Has :: between key and value. Key is highlighted. Does not indent items.
   - Karel Capek   :: Povetron
   - Karel Capek   :: Valka s Mloky. The description list also wraps very nicely after the : : .
   - Abrakah Dabra :: Is cool.

* Code highlighting

Needed =htmlize= to work.

Sh code:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code :results raw

  AVAR="something 1"
  OTHER="soma else"

  echo "Variable AVAR is set to ${AVAR}"
  if [ $AVAR = "something" ]; then
      echo "AVAR was as expected"
  else
      echo "UNEXPECTED AVAR"
  fi

  echo "In shell, :results output is default; can add ~raw~ to not use TABLES IN RESULTS"

#+END_SRC


Python code equivalent:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :exports code

  AVAR   = "something"
  OTHER  = "soma else"

  print ("Variable AVAR is set to ") + AVAR
  if AVAR == "something":
      print( "AVAR was as expected")
  else:
      print ("UNEXPECTED AVAR")

  return "In python, :results value is default, as python returns"
#+END_SRC


* TODO Properties
:PROPERTIES:
:one:      1
:END:

A property is a key-value pair associated with an entry. Here, "entry" is:

- the whole document
- tree started with heading

Properties can be set so they are associated with a single entry, with every entry in a tree, or with every entry in an Org mode file.

Properties are like tags, but with a value. 

Where can property be defined:

- Either anywhere in file (but do it always on top) as 
  #+BEGIN_SRC org
  #+PROPERTY: property-name-string property-value-string
  #+END_SRC
- Or in a drawer just below a heading as  
  #+BEGIN_SRC org
  :PROPERTIES:
  :property-name-string: property-value-string
  :END:
  #+END_SRC

Note the syntactic difference on how the key is defined 

- in the PROPERTY section, *key is NOT surrounded with :* 
- in the :PROPERTIES: drawer, *key IS surrounded with :* 

But the *key name* is in both cases =property-name-string=

For someone using org-babel a lot, I have really only encountered use of properties in defining the overwhelmingly complex property called header-args.

For the longest time, I was confused in how properties are used  *TODO* - finish this

** Testing the =header-arguments :dir= property

*** Create some dirs

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
mkdir --parent /home/mzimmermann/tmp/{one,two,three}
echo "" > /home/mzimmermann/tmp/one/file-1.txt
echo "" > /home/mzimmermann/tmp/two/file-2.txt
echo "" > /home/mzimmermann/tmp/three/file-3.txt

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

There is a standard property with key named =dir=. This is a path to directory where Babel source blocks are executed.

This experiment shows how the =dir property= is used.

*** First result uses global (top) definition of dir = /home/mzimmermann/tmp/one

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports both :results raw
(directory-files ".")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
(. .. file-1.txt file-in-directory-one.txt)


*** Second result uses the BEGIN_ SRC  definition of dir = /home/mzimmermann/tmp/two

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :dir /home/mzimmermann/tmp/two  :exports both  :results raw
(directory-files ".")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
(. .. file-2.txt)


*** Third result uses overriden property dir
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:   :dir /home/mzimmermann/tmp/three
:END:

  This result uses the PROPERTIES  definition of dir = /home/mzimmermann/tmp/three

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp  :exports both :results raw
  (directory-files ".")
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
  | . | .. | file-3.txt |

* Tags                                                       :bb:aa:
Are labels for context (context = category)

* TODO Properies and columns

:PROPERTIES:
:COLUMNS:       %30ITEM %9Approved(Approved?){X} %Owner %11Status %10Time_Estimate{:} %CLOCKSUM %CLOCKSUM_T
:Owner_ALL:     John Peter Paul
:Status_ALL:    "In progress" "Not started yet" "Finished" ""

so this is column view?

* Problem 1: org-html-publish-to-html and org-publish-attachment messes up export from image link to html by adding file:// to html
** The better solution - creating new org mode tags which are, during org export to html translated to html understood by Jekyll. Those tags are *img:* and *post-jekyll:*

*The core of the solution is here, and now in my init.el*: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14684263/how-to-org-mode-image-absolute-path-of-export-html

With help from the above link, I created my new org mode tags: *img:* and *post-jekyll:*. Then I added functions (in init.el), managing how they are exported.

*** Test the correct solution: my specific org link types - *img:* and *post-jekyll:*

Using the new org-custom-link-img-follow works: /*expected:* a small image just after the dash/ - [[img:a-test-blog.org_test-image.png]]. More tests below.

The link above uses the "new" ~img~ tag, and generates the slash starting src: <img src="/img/a-test-blog.org_test-image.png" alt="nil"/>


But several issues:

1. The image link works in Jekyll but does not show in emacs

2. It is already obsolete in org 8. Org 9 requires a different solution. See this doc from org documentation:
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  org-add-link-type is a compiled Lisp function in ‘org-compat.el’.
  
  (org-add-link-type TYPE &optional FOLLOW EXPORT)
  
  This function is obsolete since Org 9.0;
  use `org-link-set-parameters' instead.
  
  Add a new TYPE link.
  FOLLOW and EXPORT are two functions.
  #+END_QUOTE

3. Try this
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (org-open-file "./img/a-test-blog.org_test-image.png")
  #+END_SRC

4. This line shows why the img: will not display in emacs - only file: can be image
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (when (and (equal (org-element-property :type link) "file")
  #+END_SRC

*** Test my ~img:~ link

The link ~[[img:a-test-blog.org_test-image.png]]~ after html conversion, /*expected:* a small image just after the dash/ - [[img:a-test-blog.org_test-image.png]]

*** Test my ~post-jekyll:~ link

The precondition is the post must be already org2-published

The link ~[[post-jekyll:blog-in-org-2-jekyll---1.-motivation.org][a short series about writing in org mode]]~ after html conversion, /*expected:* a working link just after the dash/ - [[post-jekyll:blog-in-org-2-jekyll---1.-motivation.org][a short series about writing in org mode]]

** The workaround solution - creating a link for images

There is a simpler but hack-ier solution to display exported images correctly: We create a directory link from the org/img directory to a img directory above the posts. This works because the generated ~<img src=../../some-img.png>~ tag in, say, 2017/04/a-test-blog.html, reaches ../../img.

This makes images works both in org and html, with the caveat the images are referenced as [../../img/some-image.png].

In more detail, do this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd $BLOG # e.g. /whatever/mzimmerm.github.io/
cd ..
ln -s $BLOG/org/img img
#+END_SRC 

If we prepare the above link (ln), we can use the "regular" ../img/some-file type link for images in org - as long as images are placed to the $BLOG/../img directory, image links will work after html conversion and serving in Jekyll.

*** Testing the workaround solution

An inline link to ~[[../../img/a-test-blog.org_test-image.png]]~ should display a image.  /*expected:* a small image just after the dash/ - [[../../img/a-test-blog.org_test-image.png]]

The link above, generates html like this: ~<img src="../../img/a-test-blog.org_test-image.png">~ which works when served in an http server, because the generated blog posts are located in ~root:2017/04/a-test-blog~, and two levels up to ~img~ exists and is not outside the http server root folder. At the same time it works in emacs org mode, as this workaround created the "faked" link directory "org/../../img", where "org" is the current directory while editing in emacs.

** Image export problem in detail (two solutions described in the two sections above):

I am using org mode publishing to html, using C-c C-e h H (tried to publish to html file as well, same result). Is there a way to specify the link in org so that the published image path starts with /, like this:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
<img src="/img/a-image.png" \>?
#+END_QUOTE

Note: The starting slash is a standard in any "normal" static html serving, as in expresses "path from the served root"

There is no way to achieve this in "out of the box" org mode*. I tried those:

| Org                          | Works? | Published as                                   |
| [/img/a-image.png]           | NO     | <img src="f ile:///img/a-image.png" \>         |
| [~/some-dir/img/a-image.png] | NO     | <img src="f ile:///some-dir/img/a-image.png"\> |
| [f ile:///img/a-image.png]   | NO     | <img src="f ile:///img/a-image.png"\>          |
| [./img/a-image.png]          | OK     | <img src="./img/a-image.png"\>                 |
| [../img/a-image.png]         | OK     | <img src="../img/a-image.png"\>                |
| [f ile:img/a-image.png]      | OK     | <img src="img/a-image.png"\>                   |

None of them results in what I am trying to get.

Basically, the publish adds the word "file:///" in the , unless the the org link image path is one of:
- ./img
- ../img ../../img etc
- file:img 

If the org links uses a absolute path, or starts with file://, the org2jekyll-publish (presumably calling org-export-to-html) adds file:/// to the img src url. This does not work when served in any http server. (A secondary question: is adding the file:/// by org2jekyll-publish a bug or is there a rationalle?)

* MathJax configurations

MathJax can be passed options to configure it to display various formats:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Allows math to be specified in TeX, LaTeX, MathML, or AsciiMath notation, with the AMSmath and AMSsymbols packages included, producing output using MathML if the browser supports it sufficiently, and HTML-with-CSS otherwise.
#+END_QUOTE

See http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/

The two sections below describe some nuances for displaying Latex and ASCIIMath in Org2Jekyll and Jekyll.

* Math Formulas using Latex

First, delete the following from the org file if present after ~org2jekyll-create-draft~:

OPTIONS: tex:t
HTML_MATHJAX: path:"http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js"
HTML_MATHJAX: align: left indent: 5em tagside: left font: Neo-Euler

The Javascript that MathJax will use, must be configured directly in Jekyll, in ~./_includes/mathjax-stuff-new.html~. Also, see the ~./_includes/mathjax-stuff.html~ which I found somewhere - maybe it's Jekyll default.

There are 3 ways to put Latex in org text:

1. Start with \begin .. \end{equation}, surround by empty lines. Example:

  \begin{equation}  x=\sqrt{b}
  \end{equation}

2. Display mode: Start with double dollar on lines above and below Latex:  ~\[..latex here..\]~ or ~$$..latex here..$$~. Examples:

  $$
  x = \sqrt{b} + c^4
  $$

  \[
  y = \sqrt{c} + d^3
  \]

3. Inline mode: Put ~\(..latex here..\)~ or ~$..latex here..$~  around latex. But this may clash on export with dollars etc. This is some latex inline, e.g. $x = \sqrt{b} + c^4$ or \(y = \sqrt{c} + d^3\) which is nice.  *Prefer using ~\(etc\)*

4. Try ~org-preview-latex-fragment~ (bound to C-c C-x C-l). s C-c C-x C-l here (or C-u C-c C-x C-l to preview everything in the subtree, or C-u C-u C-c C-x C-l to preview everything in the buffer)
 
* Math Formulas using ASCIIMath

*An important prerequisit to get this working in org export, is to customize ~org-export-with-sub-superscripts~ to 'do not interpret'. This can also be set per file using option # + OPTIONS: ^:nil*

1. Sum: `sum_(i=1)^n i^3=((n(n+1))/2)^2`

2. Prescripts: `{::}_(\92)^238U` or `{::}_92^238U` ? Both work, so use the second which is simple.

3. Separate the < sign with spaces so `x < y` displays nicely 

4. Integrals: `int_0^oo e^(-x^2) dx = sqrt(pi) / 2`

5.


** Numbering equations in ASCIIMath

   
After some trying, these are the ways to number equations - no way to do it on the right, and no way to add spacing

1. This renders nice, so just use the first, e.g. (1).

  (1) `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`

  (2) `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`

  (3) `x = (-b+-sqrt(b^2-4ac))/(2a)`


2. Below, space before dot prevents interpretation as list item li. So just use the (1,2,3) format above.

  4 . `m = (y_2 - y_1)/(x_2 - x_1) = (Delta y)/(Delta x)`

  5 . `f'(x) = lim_(Delta x->0)(f(x+Delta x)-f(x))/(Delta x)`

  6 . `d/dx [x^n] = nx^(n - 1)`

  `7 . int_a^b f(x) dx = [F(x)]_a^b = F(b) - F(a)`

  `8 . int_a^b f(x) dx = f(c) (b - a)`

  `9 . "average value"=1/(b-a) int_a^b f(x) dx`

  `10 . d/dx[int_a^x f(t) dt] = f(x)`
  
  `11 . (a + b)^n = ∑_(k=0)^n▒(n¦k) a^k b^(n-k)` This is UnicodeMath
  
  `12 . (a + b)^n = sum_(k=0)^n ((n), (k)) a^k b^(n-k)` This is AsciiMath
