TL;DR: Newspeak is a modern, principled platform and language: dynamic, reflective, modular.  It supports both object-oriented and functional styles.  But having reached here, you probably already know that much.  The purpose of this document is to help starting with Newspeak version 3 (year 2021, runs on Webassembly).  Hopefully reduce reader's start time a bit.

<div id="outline-container-org19e5dd7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org19e5dd7"><span class="section-number-4">3.0.1</span> Message (function) names notation in text</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-0-1">
<p>
We needed a brief introduction to explain a notation used in this document.
</p>

<p>
Newspeak is a class based, message based system.  All runtime operations are message sends (method calls).
</p>

<p>
What do we mean by a 'message'?  Think of it as a method or function name with parameter names (method signature). 
What do we mean by a 'message send'? T hink of it as calling (invoking) the method or function
</p>

<p>
In fact, we may use 'method name' and 'message name' interchangeably, although it is not quite precise.  Same for 'send a message' and 'call (or invoke) a method'
</p>

<p>
Here is the notation we want to introduce: When you see in text, something like <code>Rectangle &gt;&gt; #initWidth: width andHeight: height</code>, it means: "class <i>Rectangle</i> has a method named <i>initWith:andHeight</i>, with first parameter name <i>width</i> and second parameter name <i>height</i>".  If you see just <code>#initWidth: width andHeight: height</code> it means the same, but we assume the class name "Rectangle" is clear from context.  Depending on context, it could also mean "in some piece of code, we called method  <code>#initWidth: width andHeight: height</code> on an instance of a Rectangle.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the parameter names are not included and we shorten the signature to <code>#initWidth:andHeight:</code>
</p>

<p>
Examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>#main: platform args: args</code></li>
<li><code>#usingPlatform: platform</code></li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2 id="org10d1e85"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Perhaps the best high level summary of Newspeak</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
For me it is this article's summary is perhaps the best high level summary of Newspeak:  <a href="https://bracha.org/newspeak-modules.pdf">Modules as Objects in Newspeak</a>. Let me paste it here removing references that would not make sense in another context:
</p>

<p>
<i>Like Self, all computation — even an object’s own access to its internal structure  is performed by invoking methods on objects. Newspeak is class-based. Classes can be nested arbitrarily. Since all names denote method invocations, all classes are virtual; in particular, superclasses are virtual, so all classes act as mixins. Unlike its predecessors, there is no static state in Newspeak, nor is there a global namespace. Modularity in Newspeak is based exclusively on class nesting. There are no separate modularity constructs such as packages. Top level classes act as module definitions, which are independent, immutable, self-contained parametric namespaces. They can be instantiated into modules which may be stateful and mutually recursive.</i>
</p>

<p>
This is a beautiful summary. But it is also not easy to "visualize" how is this tranfered to practice in Newspeak.
</p>

<p>
This document is both a personal experience of learning Newspeak, an an attempt of making sense of the practical ways the above text means for a Newspeak user.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
TL;DR: This quickstart section attempts to provide an incremental introduction to Newspeak.  First, we introduce the Newspeak online IDE, then we build and deploy a sample Newspeak app called <code>CounterApp</code>.  A spoiler: we can look ahead and run the app we will be building - the <code>CounterApp</code> - online at <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel</a>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
TL;DR: This section introduces the online version of Newspeak IDE, and how to use it.
</p>

<p>
This is a brief section.  Starting with Newspeak is easy.  We just point the browser to <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a>.
</p>

<p>
In more detail, let us try the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Action: In a new browser tab, open the Newspeak online IDE at <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a></li>
<li>Result: The Newspeak IDE opens, similar to
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-newspeak-ide-start.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Action: To edit source code: Click the "Newspeak Source" link
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-go-to-newspeak-source.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Result: A new page opens, showing Newspeak classes, similar to
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-newspeak-source.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Note: The blue links are classes.  To view, or change them, click the class link</li>
<li>Action: Click the "+" beside the "Root" to add a class.</li>
<li>Result: A class editor opens, with a template of a new class definition.  At first, let's just create a dummy class by editing the template
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-newspeak-source-defining-a-new-class.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Action: Click the checkbox on the top right <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-accept-image.png" alt="nil"/> to "Accept" the new class definition.  Note: Clicking the "Accept" button is important.  If you make any code changes, or workspace code changes, do not forget to click "Accept", otherwise your changes will be lost immediately after moving away from the source editing page.  See the discussions in <a href="#orgafd7607">Chapter Saving changes in Newspeak</a>.</li>

<li>Result: The class now appears in the list of classes (may need to scroll down, classes are sorted alphabetically)
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-my-new-class-now-added.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Action: Return back to the main page by pressing the browser "Back" button, to get back to
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-newspeak-ide-start.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>To run some Newspeak expressions: Click the "Workspaces" link
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-go-to-workspaces.png" alt="nil"/>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Result: A new page opens, similar to
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-workspaces.png" alt="nil"/></li>
</ul></li>
<li>To run some simple one-liner code, type for example "1+2" into the text field, and press keyboard <b>Shift + ENTER</b>.  This will evaluate the expression and print a result "3"
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Result: expression "1+2" was evaluated to "3"
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-workspaces-expression.png" alt="nil"/></li>
</ul></li>
<li>To run multi-line Newspeak code, type the code line by line.  Press keyboard <b>ENTER</b> to open new lines.  When ready to run the code, <b>highlight all lines, then press keyboard Shift + ENTER</b> to run the code.  Another term for running code like this, is "evaluating all highlighted lines").  The image below shows the Workspace after the <b>Shift + ENTER</b> was pressed, showing the evaluated code, and the result of the evaluated code: <code>2</code>.
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-workspaces-multiline-expression.png" alt="nil"/>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The image above uses a white-mode image, as the dark-mode pages do not show highlight too well.</li>
<li>When running multi-line code, we can paste it from outside, instead of typing it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To save our changes "now", click the diskette "Save" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-save-button.png" alt="nil"/>.  The changes are saved in the browser local storage.  See Notes below for discussion on the details.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Notes:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We are now using Newspeak, in its full power.</li>
<li>The browser tab opened on <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a> IS the Newspeak live IDE.</li>
<li>Everything we do in the IDE is alive, changes and actions have immediate responses in the running system.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Saving your changes:
</p>

<p>
<b>Any changes we make (for example: we add a class, we change a class, evaluate something in the workspace) are stored in the browser local storage in two entries: "lastSaved" and "backup".</b> The "Accept" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-accept-image.png" alt="nil"/> saves the changes in local storage under the key "backup", while the "Save" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-save-button.png" alt="nil"/>, saves the changes under the key "lastSaved".  See <a href="#orgafd7607">Chapter Saving changes in Newspeak</a> for details.

Potential "gotchas":
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you make code changes, do not forget to click the "Accept" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-accept-image.png" alt="nil"/>.  Otherwise your changes will be lost immediately after moving away from the source editing page.</li>
<li>What is the difference between The "Save" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-save-button.png" alt="nil"/>, and the "Accept" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-accept-image.png" alt="nil"/>? 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The "Accept" button is needed to save your changes beyond moving away from the editor.  For example, if you make a change to a class method, and do not click "Accept", your changes will be lost after pressing the browser "Back" button, browser "Reload" - generally any state changes.</li>

TL;DR: This section describes 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How to create, run and debug a Newspeak app (<code>CounterApp</code>) in development mode, in the <b>online</b> Newspeak IDE.  To concentrate on the IDE handling applications, we use pre-existing code for the <code>CounterApp</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Prerequisites:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We should write code of the <code>CounterApp</code>.  However, for us to skip any implementation details and concentrate on the IDE, in this section, we will simply borrow the code.  The code of the <code>CounterApp</code> already exists - in the Newspeak github repo at <a href="https://github.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeak">https://github.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeak</a>.  We borrow it without talking about Newspeak code until later.  To fulfill the prerequisite, do one of the following:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Clone the newspeak repo locally and find two files, <code>CounterApp.ns</code> and <code>CounterUI.ns</code> from there.</li>
<li>Alternatively, download the files <code>CounterApp.ns</code> and <code>CounterUI.ns</code> from Github to the local filesystem.  To do that, just click <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeak/master/CounterUI.ns">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeak/master/CounterUI.ns</a>, then <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeak/master/CounterApp.ns">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeak/master/CounterApp.ns</a>, then right-click and select "Save as&#x2026;" to save each file.</li>
<li>Either way, note the location of the two files.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>
Notes: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To deploy the <code>CounterApp</code>, this section uses the online Newspeak at <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a></li>
<li>However, a local Newspeak webserver could be used instead.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If we wanted to deploy the <code>CounterApp</code> in "production", we would need a local Newspeak - because there is no way to deploy the app to the online Newspeak site.</li>
<li>Deployment of the  <code>CounterApp</code> to "production" requires our "own" Newspeak, such as the local Newspeak webserver.  See <a href="#org5383775">5.3</a> for how to install Newspeak locally.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We may ask, "what is an app in Newspeak"? In a nutshell, an "app" is an instance of a class - obviously.  But which class, and what does the class need, to be able to "live" or "run" inside a Newspeak IDE or Newspeak runtime? Read on for details (actually, the coding details are todo).</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Steps: To create and run the <code>CounterApp</code> (from existing code that we borrow from Newspeak Github), follow the Action/Result steps below:</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Action: In a new browser tab, open the online Newspeak IDE at <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a></li>
<li>Result: The Newspeak IDE opens, similar to <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-newspeak-ide-start.png" alt="nil"/>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Note: The "Did you know" section is a ever-changing hint system</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Action: Click "Newspeak Source" in <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-go-to-newspeak-source.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Result: A new page opens, showing Newspeak classes, similar to <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-newspeak-source.png" alt="nil"/>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Note on the result: In the result, you should NOT see classes named <code>CounterApp</code> or <code>CounterUI</code>.  If you do, you have most likely run through this tutorial before, and the classes are already in your browser local storage.  To clean any local changes saved locally for the online Newspeak, you can clean them in the browser local storage.  See</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Motivation for the next action: We want to build the sample app <code>CounterApp</code>.  We choose to build it simply by downloading and compiling two files from the existing source from the Newspeak github repo.</b></li>
<li>Action: In the top right of the page (in the same line where we see "Root +") <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-3-vertical-dots.png" alt="nil"/>, click the <b>vertical 3-dot</b> button on the far right.</li>
<li>Result: A popup  <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-compile-files.png" alt="nil"/> shows</li>

<li>Action: Click "Compile Files".  This will ask us to select files stored on disk, and compile them.</li>
<li>Result: OS file browser opens, and ask us to select files in the operating system file browser.</li>
<li>Action: Navigate to the directory where we checked out the Newspeak github repo, OR where we saved the source for the <code>.ns</code> files (see Prerequisites of this section).  Select <code>CounterApp.ns</code> and <code>CounterUI.ns</code></li>
<li>Result: <b>The classes from the selected <code>.ns</code> files compile, and show in your IDE.</b> In your class list (the list under Root +), you should now see a section similar to this <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-counter-classes.png" alt="nil"/>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Note 1: We have loaded the code of the  <code>CounterApp.ns</code> and
<code>CounterUI.ns</code> classes into Newspeak by running "Compile
file".  Alternatively, we could have added the classes through the IDE by
clicking the "+" button
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-root-plus-button.png" alt="nil"/> and typing or pasting the code in.
Instead, we choose to load pre-existing files at the moment to concentrate on the process, not the code.</li>
<li>Note 2: click the <code>CounterApp</code> or <code>CounterUI</code> link.  This shows the corresponding class.</li>
<li>Note 3: The <code>CounterApp</code> shows links to <code>[deploy] [configuration] [run] [debug]</code>.  Why do only the "app" classes such as <code>CounterApp</code> (and no other classes) show the <code>[deploy] [configuration] [run] [debug]</code> links in the Newspeak IDE? The IDE decides to show those links based on the presence of a convention method <code>#packageUsing: manifest</code>.  See <a href="#org98fdcd0">Newspeak modules API summary</a> for what makes a module an App, a Library, or a Test Configuration, and how the IDE handles the API.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Action: To save the classes we added, (<code>CounterApp</code> or <code>CounterUI</code>) in the browser local storage explicitly "now", click the diskette "Save" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-save-button.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Result: The two classes are stored in the browser local storage.  To read more about details of the browser local storage, see <a href="#orgafd7607">Chapter Saving changes in Newspeak</a>.</li>
<li>Action: click the <b>[run]</b> link beside the  <code>CounterApp</code>.  This runs the code in the app (specifically, the <code>CounterUI</code> code).</li>
<li>Result: The counter app opens and runs in the same browser tab; it should look like this:  <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-counter-app-running.png" alt="nil"/> The code presents a counter (integer), and 3 buttons, which actions are to "increment", "decrement" and "reset" the counter.</li>
<li>Action: click "increment"</li>
<li>Result: counter increments by one.</li>
<li>Note: We can click [debug] instead of [run] and a debugger will open.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Summary: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We have shown how to build, run, and debug, a Newspeak app <code>CounterApp</code> in "development mode", inside the online Newspeak IDE.</li>
<li>Newspeak online is similar to (but we dare say superior to) running, in "development mode", a Java, Android or Flutter application in IntelliJ, Eclipse, Visual Studio, Atom, Emacs, vi, or any IDE.</li>
<li>Your changes are always stored, as long as you "Accept".  See <a href="#orgafd7607">Chapter Saving changes in Newspeak</a> for saving changes details.</li>

</ul>

<p>
Prerequisites: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Python is installed on your system.  This is needed for the <code>serve.sh</code> script to run an HTTP server.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Notes: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can use a server of your choice instead of the Python server needed by <code>serve.sh</code>.  Just place all the files downloaded in the sections below to your server's serving directory.</li>
<li>You can potentially skip this section.  However, if you want to deploy a Newspeak app such as the <code>CounterApp</code>, this section is needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Action steps to download, install, and start using a local Newspeak webserver</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First, you may want to review the Newspeak downloads page at <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/downloads.html">https://newspeaklanguage.org/downloads.html</a>, in particular the <b>For all platforms</b> link.</li>
<li>Next, to install and start a local Newspeak webserver, you can 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Either download and unzip the file <b>servable.zip</b> from the link above (<a href="https://github.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeaklanguage.github.io/raw/master/servable.zip">https://github.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeaklanguage.github.io/raw/master/servable.zip</a>) to any directory, then start the Newspeak server by running <code>serve.sh</code> from the extracted file.</li>
<li><p>
Or run the following commands from the command line 
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell"><span style="color: #fcaf3e;">MY_SERVE_NEWSPEAK</span>=$<span style="color: #fcaf3e;">HOME</span>/software/newspeak/my-serve-http

curl --location https://github.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeaklanguage.github.io/raw/master/servable.zip --output $<span style="color: #fcaf3e;">MY_SERVE_NEWSPEAK</span>/servable.zip
unzip -o servable.zip

<span style="color: #73d216;"># </span><span style="color: #73d216;">The directory just above "servable" must be the directory</span>
<span style="color: #73d216;"># </span><span style="color: #73d216;">where we saved the zip file, see above.</span>

<span style="color: #e090d7;">cd</span> servable
<span style="color: #73d216;"># </span><span style="color: #73d216;">Make serve.sh executable, and start the Newspeak local server.</span>
chmod u+x serve.sh
./serve.sh
</pre>
</div></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Expected Result: "serving at port 8080".  Note: In <b>servable.zip</b> there is a file <code>server.py</code>, which defines the Newspeak server port.  The port is set to 8080.  Edit the file and change port if needed.</li>
</ul>


<p>
To use the local Newspeak webserver, navigate browser to <a href="http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a>.  This should open the locally hosted Newspeak IDE, started using the <code>./serve.sh</code> command. 
</p>

<p>
Your browser should show a page similar to 
  <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-local-ide.png" alt="nil"/>
</p>

<p>
Note: The use of the local version is the same as the use of the online version.  We can now start editing Newspeak code by clicking on the "Newspeak Source" link.

<p>
TL;DR: This section describes 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How to create and deploy the <code>CounterApp</code> into the local version of Newspeak.</li>
<li>That the deployment is achieved by creating a deployable file, <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code>, in the online Newspeak at <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a> and placing it in the running local Newspeak webserver.</li>
<li>How to run the <code>CounterApp</code> from the local Newspeak webserver, by accessing the  <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code> from the local HTTP server.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Prerequisites: 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>We have followed the online section <a href="#orgba53dc6">5.2</a>.  In that section, we have downloaded (from Newspeak Github) and compiled two classes <code>CounterApp</code> and <code>CounterUI</code> <b>while attached to the online Newspeak</b>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This statement requires a "fine point" explanation. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In the earlier section  <a href="#orgba53dc6">5.2</a>, the two classes, <code>CounterApp</code> and <code>CounterUI</code>, were saved to the browser local storage.</li>
<li>In this current section, we re-attach to online Newspeak at <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a>.</li>
<li>As explained in <a href="#orgafd7607">Chapter Saving changes in Newspeak</a>, the changes we made in the online version are still stored locally in the browser local storage.</li>
<li>So, when we re-attach to online Newspeak in this section, the classes <code>CounterApp</code> and <code>CounterUI</code> are still available.  We use them to "create the CounterApp" (by saving it "as victory fuels" - that is, as file <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code>) which is the app.</li>
<li>This app - the  file <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code> - can then be copied to the serving directory of local Newspeak, and can be opened from there.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>We have installed the local version of Newspeak by following the section <a href="#org5383775">5.3</a>.*</li>
</ol>


<p>
Notes: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We will create the deployable file, <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code> using the online Newspeak at <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a></li>
<li><b>However, apps can NOT be deployed to the online version, since that would require write access to the newspeak web site.  We can do the coding and create the deployable .vfuel file online (as described above), but the actual deployment and running of the standalone app has to be done in a Newspeak webserver we control.  We will show how to create a standalone local Newspeak webserver just a bit later.</b></li>
<li>We will deploy the deployable file with the standalone <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code>, into the local Newspeak webserver as  <a href="http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel">http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel</a>. (this link will only work when we finish all steps in this section)</li>
</ul>

<p>
One more "fine point" note:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This flipping between the online Newspeak and local Newspeak could be confusing.  We could have started by downloading Newspeak locally, and follow the whole tutorial in local Newspeak.  However, we thought that may discourage some people who want to "take the shortest path", and start online.</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>Steps: Now we have introduced the context, we start the core of this section: We create the deployable file, <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code> and deploy it to the local Newspeak, by following the Action/Result steps below:</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Action: Navigate to the online version of Newspeak at <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a> and click the "Newspeak Source"</li>
<li>Result: Under "Root" you should see an alphabetically organized list of classes, similar to <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-newspeak-source.png" alt="nil"/>, 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Note: If you followed the online section <a href="#orgba53dc6">5.2</a>, there should be <code>CounterApp</code> and <code>CounterUI</code> classes in the alphabetic list.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Action: In the class list, find the <code>CounterApp</code>, and click the [deploy] to the right of the "CounterApp"</li>
<li>Result: a popup showing deployment options, starting with <code>asVictoryFuel</code>: <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-click-deploy-on-counter-app.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Action: Select <code>asVictoryFuelWithMirrors</code>.  We choose the option 'asVictoryFuelWithMirrors' if our app uses the GUI (there's some mirror dependency in the UI) and 'asVictoryFuel' otherwise.</li>
<li>Result: After a long wait, a file named <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code> is created, and asked to be saved.</li>
<li>Action: Save the file <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code> on our disk to the directory where local Newspeak was deployed - for example <code>$HOME/software/newspeak/my-serve-http/servable</code></li>
<li>Result: <b>The counter app is now deployed to the local Newspeak webserver!</b></li>
</ul>


<p>
To prove the counter app is now deployed to the local Newspeak webserver, do the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Action: Open a new browser tab, and navigate to the just saved application  <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code> in the local Newspeak webserver as <a href="http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel">http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel</a></li>
<li>Result: In the new tab, you should see the "locally deployed" <code>CounterApp</code> is now running
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-counter-app-local-run.png" alt="nil"/></li>
</ul>

<p>
Summary: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In this section, using the online Newspeak, we built our "Newspeak production deployable" file <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code>, and deployed it to the local Newspeak version at <a href="http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel">http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel</a>.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">
<p>
On this journey, I would like to walk back and capture some of my surprises, gotchas, but also amazement of simplicity during a journey of my first week (stretched over 2 months) starting with Newspeak.  But hopefully I manage to organize this journey into a somewhat streamlined story.  Actually "the first week" is not completely correct.  I did first discover Newspeak long time ago, almost when it started, read available articles back then, and covered the syntax which helped.  But I did not have time back then to get my hands on it properly.
</p>

<p>
Most learning, and often "unlearning" for me was the discovery different the Newspeak platform is, compared to most mainstream platforms, such as Java, Python, C++, even Smalltalk (with Smalltalk, Newspeak shares syntax and extreme late boundedness).
</p>

<p>
At this moment I should give readers some links to jump off here and do this alone.  If you found this, you probably already searched to learn about Newspeak.  But I hope, if you get back here after googling and reading the links, the rest of this text may still be helpful :) ..  so, some selected links:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First of all, the home of the Newspeak language <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/">https://newspeaklanguage.org/</a> has links to all documentation, videos, installers and more.</li>
<li>Second, to run Newspeak online, navigate to  <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel</a>.</li>
<li>Next, if I was to:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>recommend selected few documents, it could be
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://bracha.org/newspeak.pdf">The Newspeak programming platform</a>, an older document, briefly introduces both the syntax, and the core principles of Newspeak.</li>
<li><a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/Literate/Literate.html">Newspeak by example</a>  which is a live document, introduces the syntax of Newspeak, sort of a Jupyter notebook for Newspeak: reader can type and evaluate Newspeak expression in a web page, interleaved with document text.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>recommend a hands-on Newspeak introduction, it could be
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Either use (still relevant where not Squeak dependent) <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/ns101/ns101.html">Newspeak on Squeak - A Guide for the Perplexed</a></li>
<li>Or follow the hands-on section <a href="#org8b291c4">Newspeak: A quickstart.  Explore the IDE.  Then develop CounterApp, package it and deploy it</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Getting back to my first week journey; it is unfair to hikers, as my journey was at times, that of a wanderer almost lost in a forest; haphazardly reading all I can get my hands on, trying code snippets things in the IDE, re-tracing running and deploying the existing <code>CounterApp</code>, and overall, taking one step forward, then two steps back as the step forward discovered more unknowns.
</p>

<p>
Some concrete talk please!
</p>

<p>
OK.  But first one more paragraph of meta-talk.  Just a heads up, I will start using the word <b>platform</b> a lot.  Let me try explain what I mean by <i>platform</i> or <i>language platform</i>.  Often we think of learning a "computer language" as learning its syntax.  But syntax is only a small part of being able to be productive in the language.  There are all those things around the syntax, that are needed to be comfortable and productive with a "computer language": How is it installed, how we create projects to start writing a useful program, the core idioms, how to use programs written by other people in that language (the libraries), how the programs we write are packaged and send to users to use (building, packaging and installing apps), how to secure the resulting program.  It is all these things listed in the long sentence that I mean by the "language platform" or "platform". 
</p>

<p>
Newspeak syntax is not a major obstacle.  Well, it is quite different too, even for someone knowing Smalltalk, which Newspeak shares syntax with.  But one can get syntax basics from the links above.  Also, Newspeak syntax is a bit like speaking English.  Just different from the mainstream.  I will not address syntax too much here.
</p>

<p>
Newspeak is a principled language and <b>platform</b> (in the sense described).  Gilad Bracha and collaborating authors describe several principles (adherence to which removes many mainstream platforms' weaknesses).  Those principles are described in the above linked paper <a href="http://bracha.org/newspeak.pdf">The Newspeak programming platform</a> and other documents.
</p>

<p>
As this section title states, Newspeak is different. <b>Being different is not for fun.  Newspeak must be different to implement its core principles</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Dynamicity</li>
<li>Modularity (including how dependencies are provided)</li>
<li>Classes can be nested (nesting provides the core of modularity)</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Reflectivity</li>
<li>intentional lack of static state</li>
<li>support for both object-oriented and functional styles</li>
<li>the only operation is a message send</li>
</ul>


<p>
I will add one multi-item principle.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Everything in the Newspeak language is an object (instance of a class). 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most(?) mainstream languages use separate concepts for packages, apps, modules, namespaces, classes.  They also use the filesystem a lot.</li>
<li>All concepts in the item above exist in Newspeak, but they are all implemented by objects.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
But, given a Newspeak object, how do we know it is a <b>module, a library, or an app</b>? The distinction between them is determined by:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the object's position in the class nesting and</li>
<li>presence of certain API (convention named methods such as <code>#main:platform args:args</code>. This is discussed in <a href="#org98fdcd0">Newspeak modules API summary</a> and other sections leading to it.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Given a Newspeak object, how does it acquire it's dependencies (objects it depends on to be functional)? This is one core point discussed at length in this text. See <a href="#orgb4743ce">Dependencies and modularity: Perhaps the hardest part of Newspeak difference</a> the links therein, and sections afer.
</p>

<p>
"Being different" does came at a steep initial learning curve (for me at least).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-2">
<p>
This section is only a quick "look ahead summary" to provide more motivation and contex for the rest of the parent chapter.
</p>

<p>
Due to Newspeak's modularity, the process of bringing dependencies into a Newspeak program is different from mainstream language platforms. Because of it, large parts of this text deals with the topic of dependencies. 
</p>

<p>
As a look ahead summary we can say that 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Every computation in Newspeak starts at an instance of a top level class. Instances of top level classes are called modules.</li>
<li>Modules can be packaged and distributed.</li>
<li>Dependencies are also modules (which some distributed module depends on).</li>
<li>The <code>manifest</code> and <code>platform</code> objects are the vehicles of bringing dependencies to objects at runtime by passing them to some "convention" API methods to modules.</li>
<li>From modules, the dependencies are also available to the distributed module's nested classes and objects.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Later sections decribe the process of bringing dependencies into a Newspeak programs. We use the <i>manifest</i> passed to module APIs, from the manifest, dependency classes are stored on slots ("imported"), later picked up from slots when needed to instantiate.  <a href="#org4633bc8">Modules: Application, library, test, general</a>, the recipy section <a href="#org465e425">Newspeak recipy for writing modules API</a>, and the <a href="#org3f7b274">Hello World in Newspeak</a> and other sections are largely about bringing dependencies into modules and objects.

To do anything useful with Newspeak, we have to use the IDE.  There is no command line per se (there is, but it is inside the IDE.  It is called the Workspace).  So let us open the Newspeak IDE to look around.  Navigate to  <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel</a>.

I the IDE, click on the "Newspeak Source" button. We see the word <b>Root</b> on top left, and below, a list of class names.

<p>
First: what is the "Root" on the top? According to documentation, this is the IDE's top namespace - <i>Root</i> is the name of the  namespace.
</p>

<p>
In Newspeak, each class in the screenshot above (AccessModifierTesting, and below) is called a <b>top level class</b>, and it belongs to the <i>Root namespace</i>.  Each <i>instance of a top level class</i> is referred to as a <b>module</b>, see <a href="#org6e890f7">Discussion of Modules</a>.  
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org6e890f7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org6e890f7"><span class="section-number-4">6.4.2</span> Discussion of Modules</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-4-2">
<p>
In software in general, <i>Modules</i> are related to namespaces in a way that we cannot precisely define here.  See <a href="#org982e2bc">Discussion of Namespaces</a> as well.  But we can say this about modules: Modules are meant to be artifacts providing some useful non trivial functionality, without needing any help - apart from the help of "dependencies" - that is, help of other modules intended to provide some "sub functionality".  There must be a way to package and distribute modules.
</p>

<p>
In Newspeak, modularity is one of the key concepts. Modules, the key constructs of modularity, are based on class nesting.
</p>

<p>
Lets again quote from <a href="https://bracha.org/newspeak-modules.pdf">Modules as Objects in Newspeak</a>: 
</p>

<p>
<i>In Newspeak, nor is there a global namespace. Modularity in Newspeak is based exclusively on class nesting. There are no separate modularity constructs such as packages. Top level classes act as module definitions, which are independent, immutable, self-contained parametric namespaces. They can be instantiated into modules which may be stateful and mutually recursive.</i>
</p>

<p>
Newspeak basically uses the following definitions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b><i>Module definition</i></b> or <b><i>Module class</i></b> is any <b><i>top level class</i></b>.  We will use the terms interchangeably.</li>
<li><b><i>Module</i></b> or <b><i>Newspeak module</i></b> is an <b><i>instance of any top level class</i></b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So, an instance of any class shown on the top level in the IDE is a <i>module</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>Newspeak Module</i> is not only an empty new term.  It turns out, that, by nesting other classes, <i>modules</i> also satisfy what we normally want from software modules: they are self-contained elements of data and functionality which can be distributed or executed, given expected API.</b>  See <a href="#org98fdcd0">Newspeak modules API summary</a>. In addition, <i>Newspeak modules</i> cannot cross-access each other when deployed - unless one module explicitly requests another <i>module</i> or <i>module class</i> during packaging and building.  
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org982e2bc" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org982e2bc"><span class="section-number-4">6.4.3</span> Discussion of Namespaces</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-4-3">
<p>
<i>Namespaces</i> in softwware in general provide grouping and organization of artifacts used in programs (packages, classes, or functions).  A Java namespace example would be "org.mypackage".  All classes in that package belong to the namespace "org.mypackage".  Python concept of a package is similar. 
</p>

<p>
Most platforms and languages have a concept and need for a <b>global namespace</b>. How can we describe it? Perhaps a good high level description of a <i>global namespace</i> would go like this: In a program, we want to use other programs, classes, functions, or what have you, created by other developers, at compile time or runtime, depending on the platform.  If our Java program is in the "org.mypackage" and a class "org.mypackage.MyClass wants to use "org.apache.SomeClass", then at compile time or at runtime, the platform (Java, but e.g.  Python is equivalent) has to find "org.apache.SomeClass".  How does it do that? By looking through CLASSPATH or PYTHONPATH.  The CLASSPATH or PYTHONPATH play the role of the <i>global namespace</i>!  All other namespaces, such as "org.apache" belong to the <i>global namespace</i>.  In a Java or Python program, any class and it's instance at runtime has access to artifacts on the CLASSPATH or PYTHONPATH. For example, this code
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #73d216;">// </span><span style="color: #73d216;">In org.mypackage.MyClass: </span>
<span style="color: #8cc4ff;">Object</span> <span style="color: #fcaf3e;">newObject</span> = Class.forName(<span style="color: #e9b96e;">"org.apache.SomeClass"</span>).newInstance();
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Creates an instance of "org.apache.SomeClass" at runtime by finding it on CLASSPATH - on the <i>global namespace</i> of Java. As long as the classloader can find "org.apache.SomeClass" on the CLASSPATH, and SomeClass has the default constructor, an instance can be created - without "org.apache.SomeClass" ever being imported to the code. Instances of classes in "org.mypackage" can create instances of classes in "org.apache" and vice versa, without importing each other.  <b>This is why the availability of the <i>global namespace</i> harms modularity, as it enables "hidden dependencies" like the one described in this short Java example!</b> 
</p>

<p>
The Newspeak language does not have a <i>global namespace</i> but the Newspeak IDE does have a <i>global namespace</i> - the <i>Root</i> on top of the IDE we have seen in the previous chapter. There is some discussion regarding why that is in <a href="#org2b1038d">Namespaces and existence of global namespace in the IDE</a>.
</p>

<p>
The consequence of <i>no global namespace in the language</i> is that, at runtime (outside of IDE), a Newspeak module class must declare it's dependency on another module class explicitly, by storing the dependency class module definition ("import" it) on it's module slot! See how all classes needed at runtime are "imported" by holding on to them on module slots in code samples, including:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In <a href="#org7bffa18">4. Hello World App using 3rd party dependency</a> the <code>HelloTranslatorLib</code> holds on to the <code>HelloTranslator</code></li>
<li>In <a href="#org818d945">4. App module: API of module that needs to be distributed as an App</a> <code>RecipyWithDepApp</code> holds on to the <code>RecipyWithDep</code>, and <code>RecipyNoDep</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For the more complete language discussion of what a namespace is, and why a global namespace is not needed in the Newspeak language, see <a href="https://gbracha.blogspot.com/2008/12/living-without-global-namespaces.html">https://gbracha.blogspot.com/2008/12/living-without-global-namespaces.html</a>.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-4-4">
<p>
The existence of the <i>Root namespace</i> in the Newspeak IDE describes one of my surprises - although I realized only later that I should be surprised.  I should have been surprised because there are many places in the Newspeak documentation describing that "Newspeak has no global namespace".  So I was wondering why this "Root", is not a global namespace? Turns out that it is! But there is an important distinction, <i>the Newspeak <b>language</b> does not have a global namespace while the Newspeak <b>IDE</b> does - it's name is "Root"</i>.
</p>

<p>
Next we can ask, why does the Newspeak IDE need a global namespace (Root), while the Newspeak language does not have one, in fact very intentionally does not have one?  The reason is, when working in the IDE, we want cross-access between the <i>module classes</i> (the <i>top level classes</i>).  At runtime, that is, after packaging and deployment of any Newspeak module (outside the IDE), only the modules intended to be used by other modules should be available!  Modules cannot freely cross-use each other, because there is no global namespace to find each other (or each other's class).  If a moduleA needs to use moduleB, moduleA must explicitly ask to include moduleB's definition (the class of moduleB) at the packaging stage.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-5-3">
<p>
First, we can see, each top level class has 4 sections.  Let's take the ActivationMirrorTestingConfiguration as an example
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A collapsible class name section for the class, <code>ActivationMirrorTestingConfiguration</code> with two sub items
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a message to class on top <code>#packageTestsUsing: manifest</code> in our class.  This message is a "core" constructor.  It is called the <b>Factory constructor</b>.</li>
<li>a list of <code>Slots</code>.  Slots are like "member variables".  Slots can only be created in the <i>factory constructor</i>!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>a list of <code>Classes</code>.  Those are nested classes of the class ActivationMirrorTestingConfiguration</li>
<li>a list of <code>Instance methods</code>.  Those are instance methods we can call on instances of ActivationMirrorTestingConfiguration</li>
<li>a list of <code>Class methods</code>.  Those are class methods we can call on the class ActivationMirrorTestingConfiguration.  They are "alternative constructors".</li>
</ol>

<p>
There is a plus ("+ ") symbol  in the header of some of them.  The reason there is no plus ("+ ") symbol beside slots, is that slots can only be added in the code of the <i>factory constructor</i>.  Add a slot from the  <i>factory constructor</i> code, and the added slot name will show in the IDE.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7c19284" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org7c19284"><span class="section-number-4">6.5.4</span> Factory constructors</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-5-4">
<p>
We mentioned the messages on top like <code>#packageTestsUsing: manifest</code> are called the <i>factory constructors</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>The core role of a <i>factory constructor</i> is to create slots.  No other method can create slots!</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>The platform objects (objects that represent the Newspeak system), and / or the dependencies objects or classes (classes that need to be "imported" from the manifest) are passed to the factory constructor and held on slots.  From there, they are available to all nested classes and nested objects of the top level instance!</b>
</p>

<p>
<i>factory constructor</i> names on the <i>top level classes</i> have an eerily similar structure.  I was asking myself why, what do they have in common.  So I listed more of the factory constructor names.  Here is the list of the <i>factory constructors</i> on some top level classes:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgb400813">
class AccessModifierTesting                 usingPlatform:       platform  testFramework: minitest = (| etc
class AccessModifierTestingConfiguration    packageTestsUsing:   manifest = (| etc
class ActivationMirrorTesting               usingPlatform:       platform minitest: m = (| etc
class ActivationMirrorTestingConfiguration  packageTestsUsing:   manifest = (| etc
class ActorsForPrimordialSoup               usingPlatform:       platform = (| etc
class AliensForV8                           usingPlatform:       platform = ( etc
class Browsing                              usingPlatform:       platform ide: webIde = ( etc
class Collections                           usingPlatform:       platform = ( etc
class CollectionsForPrimordialSoup          usingInternalKernel: ik = ( etc
class CombinatorialParsing                  usingPlatform:       platform = ( etc
class RuntimeForV8                          packageUsing:        manifest = ( etc
class Streams                               usingPlatform:       platform = ( etc
</pre>

<p>
We can see that the factory constructors accept, at first position, one of 2 arguments
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>platform</code></li>
<li><code>manifest</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
If the constructor first argument is <code>platform</code>, the constructor name always <i>starts with</i>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>#usingPlatform: platform</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
If the constructor first argument is <code>manifest</code>, the constructor name is always <b>exactly</b> one of
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>#packageUsing: manifest</code></li>
<li><code>#packageTestsUsing: manifest</code> (for tests only)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Clearly, <code>platform</code> and <code>manifest</code>, must be significant!
</p>

<p>
What are those objects? And what do they contain, why are they significant, and what role do they play in Newspeak? 
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org853369e" class="outline-4">

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-5-5-1">
<p>
So what is in the manifest, why it is significant, and what role does it play in Newspeak?
</p>

<p>
We can look at the code, and ask what Newspeak passes into the <code>manifest</code> parameter.  We find that there is only one place that calls <code>#packageUsing: manifest</code>, and it passes for <code>manifest</code> the value of object <code>ide namespacing manifest</code>.  So we can examine what <code>ide namespacing manifest</code> contains.  In Workspace, let us evaluate it:
</p>

<pre class="example">
ide namespacing manifest
</pre>


<div id="org6548d5d" class="figure">
<p><img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-ide-namespacing-manifest.png" alt="nil"/>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Drilling into the instance, we can see it is a map, and sorting by the key, we get
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org48a5499">
at: AccessModifierTesting   AccessModifierTesting
at: AccessModifierTestingConfiguration   AccessModifierTestingConfiguration
at: ActivationMirrorTesting
  etc
</pre>

<p>
We see that the <b>manifest is a map containing exactly all top-level classes in the IDE - that is, all module classes known to the IDE!</b>
</p>

<p>
So we have a experiment based answer to what the manifest object contains.

As in manifest, we can ask: what is in the platform, why it is significant, and what role does it play in Newspeak?
</p>

<p>
We can look at the code, and ask what Newspeak passes into the <code>platform</code> parameter when calling, for example, <code>#usingPlatform: platform</code>.
</p>

<p>
This is little harder than with manifest, so let's cheat a bit.  In Workspace, let us evaluate <code>platform</code>
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-workspace-eval-platform.png" alt="nil"/>
Drilling into the link "instance of PlatformWithHopscotch`number", we see a list of instances. Sorting the list, we can see it contains <code>instances</code> of a few classes that look like system classes:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org831155d">
instance of ActorsForPrimordialSoup
instance of CollectionsForPrimordialSoup
instance of FontsForHTML5
instance of GraphicsForHTML5
instance of HopscotchForHTML5
instance of JSForPrimordialSoup
instance of Kernel
instance of MirrorsForPrimordialSoup
instance of PrimordialFuel
instance of TextModule
</pre>

<p>
Classes of all of those instances also exist in the <code>manifest</code> object. 
</p>

<p>
From the above, we have a good indication as to what does the platform object contain: <b>the platform object contains instances of system classes from the manifest!</b>

The answer is somewhat common for <code>manifest</code> and <code>platform</code>, so we describe their role in this common section.
</p>

<p>
And, the common need for either  <code>manifest</code> or <code>platform</code> is modularity.  But what does that mean?
</p>

<p>
We saw that the <i>modules</i> are DEFINED AS <i>instances of top level classes</i> in Newspeak.  So in this text, we will use the term <i>module</i> and <i>module instance</i> for such top level class or its instance.
</p>

<p>
And we saw that there is no global namespace in Newspeak.  Module instances, need other objects (dependencies) to do useful work.  In Newspeak, for a module instance to "contain" ANY dependency, such dependency must be on the module instance slot (slot is like the member variable).  Also, at the point of the module construction we MUST supply such dependency.  Because only the <i>factory constructor</i> can define slots, the <b>module factory constructor must be passed everything the module needs from outside</b>.  
</p>

<p>
This is where  <code>platform</code> and <code>manifest</code> come in.  They are "special" in the sense that they supply objects and classes needed by the module.  But each happens at a special point of the module lifecycle.  This is summarized in <a href="#org4633bc8">Modules: Application, library, test, general</a>
</p>

<p>
We know any Newspeak object can have only one "slot defining" constructor (called <i>factory constructor</i>.  So any module can <b>only have one of the following factory constructors</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Factory method passing manifest, named similar to <code>#package(Something)Using: manifest</code>  - manifest is needed during packaging (imports). Only App, Library, and Test configuration modules use this factory constructor.</li>
<li>Factory method passing platform, named similar to <code>#(doSomething)usingPlatform: platform</code> - platform is needed at runtime. For  App, Library, and Test configuration modules, method passing platform in an instance method.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Which method is used on which module type? Follow the next section <a href="#org4633bc8">Modules: Application, library, test, general</a>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-6-1">
<p>
In computing, a program may be an Application (App) or a Library.  This looks arbitrary, but not without merit.  On a high level, we have the following general requirements from an App, and from a Library:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>An App must be able to <b>start execution</b> on the platform to which it is targeted (here, platform in the sense of "Linux platform", "Android platform", "Windows platform", and in our situation, the "Newspeak platform).</li>
<li>A Library must be able to be <b>instantiated, loaded or linked, then used</b>, at least in principle, by the caller App or Library on that platform.  The <i>used</i> library is often called a dependency.  The term <i>used</i> implies that the Library is <b>found</b> and <b>connected</b> to the App or Library which is using it.</li>
<li>In addition, we should be able to <b>package</b> both the App and the Library for distribution.</li>
</ol>

<p>
From the generic requirements above, App and Library need some way to perform the requirements.  Methods perform requirements, so we need some "convention" methods to perform the requirements 1, 2, 3.  Such convention methods represent an API, are are described in the following section.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgdefd475" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgdefd475"><span class="section-number-4">6.6.2</span> Application and library API in computing</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-6-2">
<p>
Following the basic requirements from the previous section <a href="#org8a546aa">6.6.1</a> in mainstream computing, we need methods such as those below.  The names are arbitrary, but conventional, and represent the APIs understood on the platform:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For an App:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To perform requirement 3, <i>packaging</i>, let's call the method <code>#package</code></li>
<li>To perform requirement 1, <i>start execution</i>, let's call the method <code>#main</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>For a Library:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To perform requirement 3, <i>packaging</i>, let's call the method <code>#packageLibrary</code></li>
<li>To perform requirement 2, <i>instantiate, load and use by the caller app</i>, let's call the method <code>#build</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
A mainstream system has the advantage of access to a global namespace - generally a filesystem via a PATH, CLASSPATH, PYTHONPATH or similar.  We discussed that earlier as well.  Inside any of these methods, during execution, the program can look and find various artifacts in needs on the platform.  If we start the method equivalent to "#main" in Python, inside #main there may be a line of code such as <code>from graphics import Rectangle</code>.  So we need the Rectangle class.  No problem, we go to the classpath, find the namespace <i>graphics</i>, there lives the module <i>graphics</i>, and the class <i>Rectangle</i> is there.  We load it and continue.

<div id="outline-container-org4ee700c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4ee700c"><span class="section-number-4">6.6.3</span> Application and library modules in Newspeak</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-6-3">
<p>
In Newspeak, everything is done via objects.  So App and Library must be an object.  Further, Newspeak starts all operations on the instances of top level classes, that is, on modules. (Modules are <i>instances of top level classes</i>, see <a href="#org6e890f7">Discussion of Modules</a>)
</p>

<p>
So in Newspeak, any App is a module, and any Library is a module.
</p>

<p>
But Newspeak cannot load anything globally.  If the API for the App and library was as defined above in <a href="#orgdefd475">Application and library API in computing</a>, applications would not run as there would be no way to bring anything from a construct such as the CLASSPATH.  In more detail if the App's <code>#main</code> method defined above was to run, and Newspeak would discover the equivalent of "import" (which is slot creation in factory constructors), it would not be able to find the "imported" dependency module.  It does not have the global namespace or access to the  PATH, CLASSPATH, PYTHONPATH or similar. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The solution is, in Newspeak, all the runtime dependencies (or rather their classes) must be passed to the <i>factory constructors</i></b>  
</p>

<p>
But, how is the solution implemented, in more details? Well, we simply add some objects to the Module factory constructors.  But which objects? 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>To build (instantiate) a Library or execute and App</b>, we need to supply the capabilities of the Newspeak platform.  This IS provided by the <i>platform object</i> analyzed in <a href="#org953587a">The platform object</a>.  So <span class="underline">we will pass the <i>platform</i> object to the execution or instantiating methods</span>.</li>
<li><b>To package     a Library or an App</b>, we need to supply all classes the Library or App needs to "carry along" in it's package.  Such "carried along" classes become slots on the module object (the "carried along" classes play the role of "imported classes" in mainstream).  In the IDE, during development of the module we are packaging, we may have been creating our own top level classes (and their nested classes obviously) needed by the module we are packaging.  Those classes do not exist on the end-user system where we will send the package for building or execution.  So all those added classes have to be "carried along" in the package.  We have seen all available classes in the IDE, including those we may have added, are supplied by <a href="#org853369e">The manifest object</a>.  So <span class="underline">we will pass the <i>manifest</i> object to the packaging methods</span>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-6-4">
<p>
This section is a summary and reference of Application, library, and test modules API in Newspeak.  It is sort of the pinnacle of the parent section about Apps and Libraries. 
</p>

<p>
<b>As explained in the previous section, in Newspeak, compared to a mainstream platform which has access to global namespace, we have to change the API signatures described in <a href="#orgdefd475">Application and library API in computing</a> by passing the <i>platform</i> and the <i>manifest</i> object.</b>  We also change the signatures to match actual Newspeak names.
</p>

<p>
<b>Here are the APIs which define whether a Newspeak module is an App, a Library, a Test Configuration, or a General module</b>.  The requirements 1, 2, 3 refer to the requirements (roles) in  <a href="#orgdefd475">Application and library API in computing</a>. Please note that Newspeak is not using the terms "App module", "Library module", "General module", or "Test Configuration module". I find it a useful classification of modules though.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Newspeak App module</b> is defined by the presence of:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Factory constructor <code>#packageUsing: manifest</code>        which performs requirement 3, <i>packaging</i>. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Implementations should set slots by pulling needed classes from the manifest</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Instance method     <code>#main: platform args: args</code>     which performs requirement 1, <i>start execution</i>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Implementations should instantiate, from slot classes and platform objects, all object needed to run the app, then call methods on them as needed.  Examples of needed objects instantiating:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Slot1 usingPlatform: platform [and: otherObjects]</i> if Slot1 is Other module</li>
<li><i>Slot2 buildUsing: platform</i> if Slot1 is a Library module</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li><b>Newspeak Library module</b> is defined by the presence of:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Factory constructor <code>#packageLibraryUsing: manifest</code> which performs requirement 3, <i>packaging</i>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Implementations should put all classes needed to build the distributed module to slots, from manifest.  Needed classes not on manifest should be created by calling A3RdPartyDependdency&gt;&gt;#packageLibraryUsing: manifest</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Instance method     <code>#buildUsing: platform</code>          which performs requirement 2, <i>instantiate, load and use by the caller app</i>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Implementations should build, then return a working instance of the module we want to distribute, NOT the instance on which this #buildUsing is defined!! Building the distributed instance will possibly call other needed dependencies #buildUsing: or #usingPlatform" methods.  Examples of how needed dependencies :
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Slot1 usingPlatform: platform [and: otherObjects]</i> if Slot1 is a General module</li>
<li><i>Slot2 buildUsing: platform</i> if Slot1 is a Library module</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Important note:  <b>If we want to distribute a module MyModule1 (this may or may not be a library module!), we have to create a separate top level Library Module, MyModule1Library for the purpose of distributing MyModule1</b>! The #buildUsing: implementation we are talking about here, is the  "MyModule1Lib&gt;&gt;#buildUsing:" method! -  NOT the  "MyModule1&gt;&gt;#buildUsing:" method, as this may not even exist on MyModule1!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li><b>Newspeak Test Configuration module</b> by convention ends with "Configuration", and is defined by the presence of:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Factory constructor <code>#packageTestsUsing: manifest</code>              which performs requirement 3, <i>packaging</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Implementations should put on slot the class of the Module being tested.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Instance method     <code>#testModulesUsingPlatform: p minitest: m</code>  which performs requirement 2, <i>instantiate</i>, 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Implementations should call return instance of the tested class.  Example: ^{AccessModifierTesting usingPlatform: platform testFramework: minitest}</li>
<li>Note: If class MyTestModule has the test methods, MyTestModuleConfiguration must be created.  This is the class we are talking about</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li><b>Newspeak General module</b> is <i>any other module</i> - any module that does not have any of the above API.  General modules <b>do not have any convention API name</b>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>However, we often find they have a <i>factory constructor</i> named <b>similar to</b> <code>#usingPlatform: platform [and: otherObjects]</code> which create a working instance. Note that the [and: otherObjects] portion is completely free, it can be named differently.  
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>These modules can for example be 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>modules we distribute using the <i>Library Distribution module</i></li>
<li>tests we run using the <i>Test Configuration module</i></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that the methods which <b>perform the packaging</b>, are <i>factory constructors</i>, while the methods which perform <b>execution or build</b> are <i>instance methods</i>.  The reason is, a <i>factory constructor</i> is the only method which can store stuff in slots! So any classes modules need to "carry along" ("import" using manifest) must be put to slots during a factory constructor call.
</p>

<p>
Note that the IDE uses some of those methods to show appropriate action links.  For example,
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The presence of method <code>#packageUsing: manifest</code> in the module, IDE shows links to <b>[deploy] [configurations] [run] [debug]</b></li>
<li>The presence of method <code>#packageTestsUsing: manifest</code> in the module, IDE shows links to <b>[run tests] [show tests]</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
This next step describes an example of a module which is intended to be distributable as a library. In Newspeak, <b>this means such module must be both packageble and distributable</b> - the roles of "packageble" and "distributable" are achieved by implementing the 2 methods below. We call such modules informally <i>library modules</i>.
</p>

<p>
In the previous section, we introduced a general module <code>RecipyWithDep</code>. If we needed this module to be packagable as a library, add the following:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Add a <b>separate module</b> with a descriptive name (to make clear it is a library), such as <code>RecipyWithDepLib</code></li>
<li>In this <b>separate module</b>, provide the following API:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Factory constructor <code>#packageLibraryUsing: manifest</code>, which allows "imports"</li>
<li>Instance method     <code>#buildUsing: platform</code>, which allows dependencies to be pulled at construction time</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that in this case, <i>#buildUsing: platform</i> must not be added any other arguments. Any "carry along" (imported) classes that may be needed at build time, must be saved on slots in the <i>#packageLibraryUsing: manifest</i> factory constructor.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-8-3">
<p>
In this section, we will build a Hello World which is a <i>module</i> (a <i>instance of top level class</i> as we know already).  The <a href="#org98fdcd0">Newspeak modules API summary</a> section would classify this as "General" module, because it does not have any of the special convention methods in it's API.  The only method of this class is it's default <i>factory constructor</i> <code>#new</code>.
</p>

<p>
Steps to create the Hello World general module in the Newspeak IDE's
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In "Newspeak Source", on the top left, click the "+ " button next to the link "Root"</li>
<li>In the popup, select "Add Class"</li>
<li><p>
Replace the text under "Defining a new class" with
</p>
<pre class="example">
class HelloWorldGeneralModule = ('Hello World ' out)()
</pre></li>

<li>It should now look like
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-hello-world-general-module.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Click the "Accept" <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-accept-image.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Now the class link "HelloWorldGeneralModule" will appear in the list of classes</li>
<li>Click on the class link, and the class presented appears
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-hello-world-general-module-class-viewer.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>What happened?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First of all the "Hello World" shows on the bottom again.</li>
<li>How did it get there?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Clicking the class link, prepares to present the class.  In the IDE, the class is presented inside an instance of itself.  So, an instance of <code>HelloWorldGeneralModule</code> is created, by calling the implicit "#new" factory constructor.  The code of the factory constructor is <code>'Hello World ' out</code>.  This code, when running, appends the text to the end of the body.</li>
<li>Similarly, every time we just click on the &gt; in the class list beside the class, a new instance is created (to serve the presented, and one more 'Hello World' appears
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-hello-world-3-times-after-body.png" alt="nil"/></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
This concludes the section on General Module class.  Before the next step, please reload the page, and select the third option to start fresh.  Alternatively, remove the class HelloWorldGeneralModule.  Presence would repeatedly output "Hello World" at the end of the page body.  Class deletion can be done by clicking on the three dot popup menu  beside the classname, and selecting "Remove HelloWorldGeneralModule"

By now, we know that <i>modules</i> are <i>instances of top level classes</i>, see <a href="#org6e890f7">Discussion of Modules</a>.  In <a href="#org98fdcd0">Newspeak modules API summary</a> we have shown that providing modules with convention API methods understood by tools such as the IDE, modules can behave as Apps, Libraries, or Tests.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="#org98fdcd0">Newspeak modules API summary</a> describes the API for a module to be able to behave as an App on the Newspeak platform. 
</p>

<p>
Steps to create the <code>HelloWorldApp</code> in the Newspeak IDE's
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
As shown in the previous section, click the "+ ", paste the following class to the IDE, and click the "Accept" button.
</p>
<pre class="example">
class HelloWorldApp packageUsing: manifest = ()
(
  public main: platform args: args = (
    'Hello World from HelloWorldApp' out.
  )
)
</pre></li>
<li>You should see the class in the top classes list.  However, (as opposed to previous section <code>HelloWorldGeneralModule</code>), our class has the links <b>[deploy] [configurations] [run] [debug]</b> beside it.  This is because the presence of <code>#packageUsing: manifest</code> makes it an App.  The tools (the IDE) understand this message and use it to show actions that can be done with an App: run, debug, deploy, show available configurations.  Presence of <code>#main: platform args: args</code> makes the module runnable as a standalone App.</li>
<li>Click the <b>[run]</b> link to run the app inside the IDE.  The IDE calls first the <code>#packageUsing: manifest</code>, then the <code>#main: platform args: args</code> which runs, and the text 'Hello World from HelloWorldApp' will be appended after the page body.
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-hello-world-app-output.png" alt="nil"/></li>
</ul>


<p>
Next, we will show how to deploy our <code>HelloWorldApp</code> as a standalone App.  From the section <a href="#orgaadf932">5.4</a> we know an App can be packaged and deployed standalone into a local Newspeak webserver. 
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Action: In the class list, find the <code>HelloWorldApp</code> again, and click the [deploy] to the right.</li>
<li>Result: a popup showing deployment options, starting with <code>asVictoryFuel</code>: <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-click-deploy-on-counter-app.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Action: Select <code>asVictoryFuel</code>.  We choose the faster option 'asVictoryFuel' because our App does not have GUI.  Otherwise, we would select 'asVictoryFuelWithMirrors'</li>
<li>Result: After a long wait, a file named <code>HelloWorldApp.vfuel</code> is created, and asked to be saved.</li>
<li>Action: Save the file <code>HelloWorldApp.vfuel</code> on our disk to the directory where local Newspeak was deployed - for example <code>$HOME/software/newspeak/my-serve-http/servable</code></li>
<li>Result: <b>Assuming you installed you local Newspeak webserver as in e <a href="#org5383775">5.3</a>, the app is now deployed to the local Newspeak webserver!</b></li>
<li>Action: Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HelloWorldApp.vfuel">http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HelloWorldApp.vfuel</a></li>
<li>Result: We see the output of the standalone-running app
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-hello-world-app-standalone-output.png" alt="nil"/></li>
</ul>

<p>
This concludes the section on App Module class.  We have shown how to create an App, run it in IDE, create a deployable .vfuel file, then deploy the App standalone in local Newspeak webserver.

<div id="outline-container-org7bffa18" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org7bffa18"><span class="section-number-4">6.8.5</span> 4. Hello World App using 3rd party dependency</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-8-5">
<p>
This section builds on previous sections to create an App, <code>HelloWorldAppUsingLib</code>  which depend on a 3rd party library module. 
</p>

<p>
Let's pretend our App can use a Newspeak module produced by a 3rd party (3rd party to us). Call the 3rd party the <i>TranslatorCorp</i>. Let's pretend <i>TranslatorCorp</i> provides the module <code>HelloTranslator</code>, packaged as <code>HelloTranslatorLib</code>.
</p>

<p>
<i>TranslatorCorp</i> would implement and package their modules as follows:
</p>

<pre class="example">
class HelloTranslator = ()
(
    public translate: text = (
      text = 'Hello World from HelloWorldApp' ifTrue: [^ 'Hallo Welt von HelloWorldApp'.].

      ^ 'unable to translate'.
    )  
)
</pre>

<pre class="example">
(* Library (distribution) class provides packaging and building of the HelloTranslator module *) 
class HelloTranslatorLib packageLibraryUsing: manifest = (
    | 
    HelloTranslator = manifest HelloTranslator. 
    |
)
(
   public buildUsing: platform = (
     |helloTranslator|
     helloTranslator:: HelloTranslator new.

     ^helloTranslator.
   )
)
</pre>

<p>
Note that for every module the <i>TranslatorCorp</i> wants to distribute (such as <code>HelloTranslator</code>), they need to create a library module for packaging and disctribution(such as <code>HelloTranslatorLib</code>)
</p>

<p>
The <code>HelloTranslator</code>, hence the <code>HelloTranslatorLib</code> 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>could have used (depended on) other module <code>HelloTRanslatorHelper</code>  developed by the <i>TranslatorCorp</i></li>
<li>and also depend on a module <code>LanguageSelectorLib</code> developed by another entity <i>LanguageCorp</i> (so <i>LanguageCorp</i> is "3rd party to <i>TranslatorCorp</i>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Then, the <i>TranslatorCorp</i> would work in their helper module and the <i>LanguageCorp's</i> module as follows:
</p>

<pre class="example">
(* This version of HelloTranslatorLib is not ready yet due to missing
   HelloTranslatorHelper and LanguageSelectorLib.
   Use the above version in your IDE experiments
*)
class HelloTranslatorLib packageLibraryUsing: manifest = (
  | 
  HelloTranslator = manifest HelloTranslator.
  HelloTranslatorHelper = manifest HelloTranslatorHelper.
  LanguageSelectorLib = manifest LanguageSelectorLib packageLibraryUsingManifest: manifest.
  |
)
(
  public buildUsing: platform = (
    |defaultlanguageSelector helloTranslator|

    defaultlanguageSelector = LanguageSelectorLib buildUsing: platform.

    helloTranslator = HelloTranslator
                        helpedBy: (HelloTranslatorHelper new)
                        with3rdPartyLanguageSelector: defaultlanguageSelector.
    (* or #usingPlatform:helpedBy:with3rdPartyLanguageSelector: if platform was needed *)

    ^helloTranslator.
  )
)
</pre>


<p>
Either way, we would develop our App by packaging the 3rd party dependency and storing it on slot as <code>helloTranslatorLib</code>, then at runtime, build instance of the <code>helloTranslator</code> using the packaged <code>helloTranslatorLib</code>, and last, calling the method on <code>helloTranslator</code> which performs the translation:
</p>

<p>
This is how the App <code>HelloWorldAppUsingLib</code> would look. 
</p>

<pre class="example">
class HelloWorldAppUsingLib packageUsing: manifest = (
  |
  helloTranslatorLib = manifest HelloTranslatorLib packageLibraryUsing: manifest.
  |
)
(
  public main: platform args: args = (
    |helloTranslator|
    helloTranslator:: helloTranslatorLib buildUsing: platform.

    (helloTranslator translate: 'Hello World from HelloWorldApp') out.
  )
)
</pre>

<p>
As shown in the previous section <a href="#orgc4a4799">3. Hello World App</a>, we can both run the App from the IDE, or package it a ".vfuel" file, and distribute to run as a standalone App from a local Newspeak webserver (or as an Electon based on Android, iOS, or desktop, but this is not shown yet).
</p>

<p>

<p>
Electron is basically Chromium underneath.  It's just set up to read from a page that's built in to the app.  So no server needs to be started.  It starts with starting the app.
</p>

<p>
An advantage of Electron that I have seen is a better integration with OS File access dialogues.  It doesn't insist on using a downloads directory for everything (and while browsers let you set the directory, they don't let you change it on the fly, on a file-by-file basis).

If the build isn't working for you there is one option that hasn't been discussed, which is relevant to Linux folk who don't have an Electron app.  You can get the web IDE vfuel file at:

<p>
BUT &#x2026;  this isn't enough because you need a bunch more stuff, such as primordialsoup.html, primordialsoup.js, primordialsoup.wasm.
If you run that, you'll find that you also need a longish list of .png files for the various images used by the IDE.  Here they are (probably a few that are no longer used too).

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-8-1-2">
<p>
Could there be situations we do not want to simply reinstall the local Newspeak webserver? Perhaps one example of such situation is that we run our local Newspeak webserver with changed files, and we want to patch a class that has a known fix, without reinstalling the local Newspeak webserver and losing changes.
</p>

<p>
To describe a concrete (somewhat artificial) situation: Let's say that on Github, there is a bug fix or change in a 'system' class, <code>Browsing.ns</code>, and we want to update this single class locally.  We can identify changed files or files with fixes, and compile them in (that is, start using them in) the local version, using the following process:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Look for files committed on Github.</li>
<li>Find files changed since your last local install - let's say file <code>Browsing.ns</code> changed today to fix a bug.  As your local server uses the servable.zip file, <code>Browser.ns</code> is already compiled in your local vfuel.</li>
<li>So from the browser IDE, <a href="http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a> from the 3-dot I "compile" the new version of Browsing.ns</li>
<li>Save the changes from IDE (clicking the save diskette image)</li>
<li>You can confirm that your changes were "Compile"d, by exporting of Browsing.ns (click the "Save to file" button to export the code).</li>
<li>The result of the above process is your local server are now using the github-fixed <code>Browsing.ns</code>.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-2">
<p>
TL;DR: Changes can be saved either <i>inside the browser</i> in the browser's local storage, or, <i>outside the browser</i> on the filesystem.  Any changes you make (for example: you add a class, change a class, evaluate something in the workspace) are stored in the browser local storage in two entries: <b>lastSaved</b> and <b>backup</b>.  Clicking the "Accept" button  <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-accept-image.png" alt="nil"/> saves the changes in local storage under the key <i>backup</i>, while clicking the "Save" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-save-button.png" alt="nil"/>, at any time after "Accept", saves the changes under the key <i>lastSaved</i>.  Alternatively, you can `export` code by clicking the "three dot menu" button to the right of the class, then clicking the "Save to file" item in the popup menu.  You can `import` code by clicking the "three dot menu" on the top, to the right of "Root +", then selecting the "Compile File(s)" in the popup menu.

<h4 id="org1aa0e14"><span class="section-number-4">8.2.1</span> Saving changes inside the browser</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-8-2-1">
<p>
How is the browser local storage handled, and how is <i>lastSaved</i> different from <i>backup</i>? Here is a detail description of how changes are saved and restored:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>After making any code change or addition, to keep your changes, you have to click the "Accept" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-accept-image.png" alt="nil"/>.  Clicking "Accept" saves the changes in local storage under the key <i>backup</i>.</li>
<li>while</li>
<li>Clicking the "Save" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-save-button.png" alt="nil"/>, at any time after "Accept", saves the changes under the key <i>lastSaved</i> (the changes under <i>backup</i> are added and merged in to the changes under <i>lastSaved</i>).  Once saved using the "Save" button, changes are stored "forever", unless you reset browser local storage for the site.  We need to clarify, that making a change, followed by just clicking "Save" without a previous "Accept", nothing is saved.  So "Accept" and "Save" are sort of like two phase commit.</li>
<li>You can view the changes made, in the browser debugger.  For example, in Chrome or Chromium:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Press F12 to open Chrome debuger.</li>
<li>Then click the "Application" tab.</li>
<li>In the "Storage" section expand "Local Storage".</li>
<li>You can see our changes in the appropriate URL, both under the key <i>lastSaved</i> and the key <i>backup</i>.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>How does the/lastSaved/ and <i>backup</i> system work on browser restart? On restart, the Newspeak system checks to see if there are any changes under the key <i>backup</i> and/or under the key <i>lastSaved</i>.  If <i>lastSaved</i> changes exists, we check if there are any subsequent changes under <i>backup</i>.  If not, we use the <i>lastSaved</i> version.  If there are unsaved changes (<i>backup</i> entry exists), a dialog will come up asking you how to proceed:  <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-message-restore-from-backup.png" alt="nil"/>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This message tells us, we did make code changes, then clicked "Accept" <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-accept-image.png" alt="nil"/>, without pressing "Save" <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-save-button.png" alt="nil"/>, and reloaded the page.  In other words, changes are stored under the key <i>backup</i> but not(yet) under <i>lastSaved</i>.  In most situations, pressing <b>Restore from backup</b> is the best choice.  Your code will load the changes from the <i>backup</i> key, and contain all your changes.  At any time, you can click "Save" and merge the <i>backup</i> changes to <i>lastSaved</i>.</li>
<li>For search purposes, here is the text of the message: "You have backup changes that are newer than your last save.  Do you want to restore these changes, or load from the last save?"</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Note: There is a fine point we should make.  Crudely, we can say that "the Newspeak IDE is the file <code>HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</code> interpreted by the browser when pointing to the URL <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a>.  However, we need to realize that the browser immediately downloads and caches this file.  Changing anything in Newspeak (adding a class, typing to the Workspace), causes the changes to be saved locally.  If we close the browser, and visit the same online URL again, we will see the site as we left it - with the local changes "added" to the vanilla Newspeak IDE! Which local changes are "added" (<i>backup</i> or <i>lastSaved</i> or both), is determined by your answer to the dialog above.</li>

<li>Caveats: There are a few caveats - a few classes are exempt from this "backup" and "lastSaved" method, due to bootstrap issues (things like KernelForPrimordialSoup and HopscotchWebIDE).  If you tamper with these - save the class explicitly! Also, web storage can surprise you on mobile platforms, where things can be thrown out after a certain amount of time (7 days on iOS?) and the system as a whole may exhibit bugs.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-orga7e210e" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orga7e210e"><span class="section-number-4">8.2.2</span> Saving changes outside the browser:</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-8-2-2">
<p>
Apart from the <i>lastSaved</i> and <i>backup</i> in-browser changes management, you can save changes outside the browser.  This is typically needed for development.
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you do clear your browser local storage, your changes will be lost, so saving outside the browser is valuable.</li>

<li>During development in Newspeak, you will want to save your work.  Until source control is integrated into the IDE, the current approach is to `export` ("Save to file") all classes you changed in a directory on your system as <b>.ns</b> files, and potentially create a code repository in that directory.  If we later want for Newspeak to use the repository version, we ("Compile File(s)") the <b>.ns</b> files back to Newspeak.  For how to access the "Save to file" and "Compile File(s)" buttons, see TL;DR in section <a href="#orgafd7607">Chapter Saving changes in Newspeak</a></li>

Snippets of wisdom
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is a recipy how to implement what would be static variables in other languages: Anything that you expected to put in a static variable goes in an instance variable of a module. What about singleton classes? How do I ensure that there’s only one instance? The easiest way is to initialize a read only slot of a module with an object literal. What happens if there are multiple instances of the module declaration? Well, each module has its own “singleton”. That’s exactly what happens with singleton classes in Java when they are defined by multiple class loaders.</li>
<li>From <a href="https://bracha.org/newspeak-modules.pdf">https://bracha.org/newspeak-modules.pdf</a> Like Self, all computation — even an object’s own access to its internal structure  is performed by invoking methods on objects. Newspeak is class-based. Classes can be nested arbitrarily. Since all names denote method invocations, all classes are virtual; in particular, superclasses are virtual, so all classes act as mixins. Unlike its predecessors, there is no static state in Newspeak, nor is there a global namespace. Modularity in Newspeak is based exclusively on class nesting. There are no separate modularity constructs such as packages. Top level classes act as module definitions, which are independent, immutable, self-contained parametric namespaces. They can be instantiated into modules which may be stateful and mutually recursive.</li>
<li><p>
StringTest&gt;&gt;#testShout is the Smalltalk way of identifying the testShout method of the StringTest class.  When you actually type the code into the browser, you don’t have to type the class name or the &gt;&gt;; instead, you just make sure that the appropriate class is selected.  Documentation example in text should show abstract argument names:
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org01493c4">
History&gt;&gt;goBackward
  self canGoBackward ifFalse: [self error: 'Already on the first element'].
  stream skip: --2.
  ^ self next.

History&gt;&gt;goTo: aPage
  stream nextPut: aPage.
</pre></li>
<li><p>
In Newspeak, a top level class declaration is always a module declaration.  So this is a module:
</p>
<pre class="example">
class HelloBraveNewWorld usingPlatform: platform = (
  platform squeak Transcript open show: ‘Hello, Oh Brave new world’.
)
</pre>
<p>
If we had written
</p>
<pre class="example">
      class HelloBraveNewWorld = (
        Transcript open show: ‘Hello, Oh Brave new world’.
      )
</pre>
<p>
and then created an instance via <code>HelloBraveNewWorld new</code> (if a class doesn’t specify a message for creating instances, new is the default), we would get a doesNotUnderstand: error, because HelloBraveNewWorld does not understand the message Transcript.  There simply is no way to access the standard output stream, or any other system state, without having it passed in via a parameter when a module is instantiated.
</p></li>
<li>Workspace evaluation
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>ide namespacing manifest Collections</code> (* Collections class *)</li>
<li><code>collections</code>  (* instance of CollectionForPrimodialSoup *)</li>
<li><code>(ide namespacing manifest ATranslation) new translate: 'aaa'</code> (* 'cannot translate', good *)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you are learning, make everything public.  everything = each method, slot, and inner class.  It may not be the right thing, but it helps as the error messages are not the best currently.  You will just get "Does not understand" too many times.  First time it took me a day to figure out hehe.</li>
<li>so, basically, if I have an HTML string with a &lt;div class='helpButton'&gt;, this code in ClassPresenter&gt;&gt;helpText:  can insert a Hopscotch(?) instance of  HelpButton (assuming HelpButton was implemented) and the HelpButton instance will present itself as Html on that div? Hmm, maybe that org-to-ampleforth just got more exciting - but I have to hold myselt. &#x2013; answer: Pretty much.  You need to define the mapping from div classes to Newspeak widgets, as ClassPresenter&gt;&gt;helpText: does for the widgets it uses.</li>
<li>Library is an informal term.  Any Newspeak module definition (i.e., a top level class) is a library, and to use, it you call its class methods, most likely to instantiate it. If you want to deploy a module, you need to use it via an app (i.e, define something with #packageUsing: and #main:args:), directly or indirectly.</li>
<li>Hopscotch: Compositionality is one of the most crucial, and most often overlooked, properties in software design; it’s what sets Hopscotch apart.</li>

Newspeak doesn't have an image.  So what do I actually do to develop software? I mean, I presume I run a copy of Newspeak somehow, and start adding classes to it.  But then where / how do my additions get saved if there isn't an image? When I've added a couple of classes to a running Newspeak environment, I presume they don't just disappear when I switch my computer off? So where do they go? Or where do I put them?
</p>

<p>
Changes in Newspeak are always saved locally, as long as you click the "Accept" button after making changes.
</p>

<p>
It won't save your state, but it will save your code.  Bear in mind that the web-based system is young and will crash occasionally, but also that <b>the system saves your changes as backup regardless of whether you saved explicitly</b>.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-9-1-3">
<p>
As discussed in <a href="#orgb4743ce">Dependencies and modularity: Perhaps the hardest part of Newspeak difference</a>:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Due to Newspeak's modularity, the process of bringing dependencies into a Newspeak program is different from mainstream language platforms. See the above linked section for an introduction and more links regarding dependencies in Newspeak.</li>
<li>The <code>manifest</code> and <code>platform</code> objects, along with the module APIs where these objects are used, are the mechanism to bring dependencies into modules (and their nested classes and their instances).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Folow the above link and also the <a href="#org3f7b274">Hello World in Newspeak</a> section for concrete examples of bringing dependencies.
</p>

<p>
Text below provides an additional example introduced by Gilad Bracha on the Newspeak Google groups list.
</p>

<p>
Imagine a convention whereby <b>every library intended for distribution is sent out as a class which:</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>has a factory (or in general, class method) method <code>#packageLibraryUsingManifest: manifest</code> -</li>
<li>has a <code>#buildUsing: platform</code> method - this method, given a platform object, produces a working instance of the module we actually want to distribute</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now developer A (Alice) intends to distribute a module MyMod1.
It depends on some other code she developed, say, MyMod2, which in turn depends on a 3rd party library from developer B (Bob).
The module Alice distributes is below.
</p>

<pre class="example">
class MyMod1DistributionLib packageLibraryUsingManifest: manifest = ( 
 (* packageManager: ...  metadata describing the expected dependencies *)
  |
  MyMod1 = manifest MyMod1.
  MyMod2 = manifest MyMod2.
  My3rdPartyDep = manifest My3rdPartyDep packageLibraryUsingManifest: manifest.
  |
) (
   public buildUsing: platform = (
      |
      my3rdPartDependency = My3rdPartyDep buildUsing: platform.
      myMod2 = MyMod2 usingPlatform: platform and: my3rdPartDependency.
      myMod1 = MyMod1 usingPlatform: platform mod2: myMod2.
      |
     ^myMod1
   )
)
</pre>

<p>
The <code>#build: platform</code> method encapsulates the knowledge of how to build Alice's code, using an internal library she wrote (MyMod2) and Bob's library.  
</p>

<p>
Note that Alice is using the same convention as Bob, and builds Bob's code with no knowledge of its internal dependencies.
Developer C (Carol) uses these same conventions to build Alice's code.  She can do so regardless of whether
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>she is <b>building an app</b> (where she'd call <code>#packageLibraryUsing: manifest</code> from the app's factory, and <code>#build: platform</code> from <code>#main: platform args: args</code></li>
<li>or she is <b>building another library</b> (where she'd call <code>#packageLibraryUsing:</code> from the library factory).</li>
</ul>

<p>
If Alice decides to replace Bob's code with code from developer D (David), she changes MyModules, but Carol's code does not change.  Likewise, if Bob or David change their dependencies, neither Alice nor Carol change their code.
</p>

<p>
It isn't necessary for everyone to follow the exact same convention - what's critical is that a given module maintains its convention so its build API is stable.  Of course, a common convention is good, especially for tools. 
</p>

<p>
Alice could just distribute an instance of MyModules, but this hard-wires the versions of all the dependencies.  Assuming she doesn't do that, it is true that Carol needs to download all the pieces and their sub-pieces from Bob and Alice etc.  She loads them into the IDE (or the IDE does so by reading the metadata) and the IDE's namespace is used to produce the manifest object passed in when anyone builds an app.
</p>

<p>
Note that <code>platform</code> and <code>manifest</code> need are quite different.  Manifests are a development thing.  Platforms are a deployment thing.
</p>

<li><code>Platforms</code> are for runtime capabilities and are security critical.  The platform is something that gives you the only connections to the world outside Newspeak.</li>

Anyway, hopefully this helps to answer the question.

Why will you refresh? Apart from the odd crash, the more common problem is the performance issues that have been discussed in this forum in December/January.  Basically, we have an unresolved problem that the system slows down painfully under prolonged/heavy use.  Refreshing and loading from backup works fairly well.  This is obviously unacceptable as you lose IDE state (debuggers, workspace/inspector contents, unsaved editors, presenter state such as what method presenters are expanded or collapsed) but it's better than an unresponsive (sluggish to dead) system.

Only classes that the IDE considers apps (applications) show these links.

<p>
IDE concludes a class is an app based on a convention: presence of method <code>#packageUsing: manifest</code>.

TL;DR: For a detail description of developing, packaging, running and deploying a concrete Newspeak app, read the section <a href="#org8b291c4">5</a>. This process is also described more succintly in the 'Hello World' programs section <a href="#orgc4a4799">3. Hello World App</a>.
</p>

<p>
The text below is a general introduction of how a Newspeak App can be made ready for deployment.
</p>

<p>
How would I go about building and running a "Hello world" application? I know I can create a class, in the browser IDE ..  ok ..  but from there, how to I "create and deploy the application" so I end up with something like the Todo app &#x2026;  any high level notes on that?
</p>

<p>
<b>There are two options to build an app</b>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Easy but flaky.  There is a 'deploy' option that the IDE displays
for apps.  It's buggy and slow, but mostly works if you are
prepared to wait a ridiculous amount of time, and tolerate the fact
that the app will be too large due to bugs in the serialization
code :-(.  We need to fix that, but you can deploy apps that way,
especially if they are small.  You choose the option
'asVictoryFuelWithMirrors' if your app uses the GUI (there's some, probably gratuitous, mirror dependency in the UI)  and 'asVictoryFuel' otherwise.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Details:  where is the [deploy] button.  Go to "Newspeak source".  Look at HopscotchWebIDE class (it's the one app pre-loaded in the system).  You'll see the deploy link in two places.  In the Root namespace itself - if your window is wide enough, it will show on the same line as the link for the class.  If you open the class, it will be at the top, to the right of the class name.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Slightly more complex, but works better.  You use a script that runs the C version of the PSoup VM to do  the deployment.  This is faster, more reliable and produces smaller deployments.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In either case, .vfuel file is produced.  Assuming you are running Newspeak using option 1 (a local server, <a href="#org8825ff5">7.1.1</a>), you can then serve that file and run your app.
</p>

<p>
<b>Deployment of the app</b>
</p>

<p>
This .vfuel can then be deployed into a (locally installed) Newspeak server.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For instructions on how to install the server see <a href="#org8825ff5">7.1.1</a></li>
<li>For instructions on how to deploy a sample app, in particular the <code>CounterApp</code>, see <a href="#orgaadf932">5.4</a>.</li>
