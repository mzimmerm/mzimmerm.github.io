This post is part 3 of  <a href="{% post_url 2017-04-08-blog-in-org-2-jekyll---1.-motivation %}">a short series about writing in org mode</a> using org2jekyll.
</p>


<p>
The Jekyll theme on this page is slightly modified from the original <b>jekyll clean</b> theme. If you like the theme, you can use it from this blog, or from the original site <a href="https://github.com/scotte/jekyll-clean">https://github.com/scotte/jekyll-clean</a>
</p>

<p>
The theme (optionally) uses Disqus for comments and (optionally) includes Google Analytics. Both are off by default, and can be changed in <code>config.yml</code>
</p>

<p>
To use this theme for a blog, look at the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">Jekyll docs</a> and the original site <a href="https://github.com/scotte/jekyll-clean">https://github.com/scotte/jekyll-clean</a>. Here are a few notes about about which files can be kept, modified, or removed for a reuse.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can generally keep the following directories and <code>.html</code> files. <b>They are mostly Liquid language sections (Liquid templates), linked from the front page or used to build pages and posts (from files in the _layouts directory)</b>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Files to keep or modify:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>index.html</code> is the blog "front page". <b>keep this file</b> as it is the Liquid template that builds the front page by querying what blogs are out there.</li>
<li><code>about.html</code></li>
<li><code>archive.html</code></li>
<li><code>links.html</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Directories and contents to keep or modify:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>_layouts</code> 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>contains files such as <code>post.html</code> and <code>page.html</code>. These files define the top level structure of your blog pages or web sites. If you create a org file named <code>org/a-test-blog.org</code> and give it <code>#+LAYOUT: post</code>, then the result post is created from  <code>post.html</code> , substituting <code>{ { content } }</code> tag in the  <code>post.html</code> with  <code>_posts/a-test-blog.html</code> ( <code>_posts/a-test-blog.html</code> is first created by <code>org2jekyll-publish-posts</code> from the org file with same name). In the process, Jekyll transforms and injects files from the <code>_includes</code> directory, if so directed by the layout file <code>post.html</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>_includes</code> 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>is the directory where all files mentioned in include tag markup  should be located - files used in includes such as <code>{ % include included-file.html % }</code> (with the space before / after the percentage removed; jekyll refuses publish a valid include markup)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>images</code> <b>todo</b></li>
<li><code>js</code> <b>todo</b></li>
<li><code>LICENSE</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li>For making your own blog, you may want to generally <b>remove content</b> of the following directories on the top level, but keep the directory nodes:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>org</code>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>directory where you write your posts and pages in org format (manually, or supported by <code>org2jekyll-create-draft</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>_posts</code>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>is a directory with:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>.html</code> files exported from <code>.org</code> files by command <code>org2jekyll-publish-pages</code></li>
<li>Also, if you want to write your posts in markdown, you write them here as <code>.md</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>_site</code>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>is a directory with <code>.html</code> files created by <b><code>jekyll build</code></b>. Files here are built by <code>jekyll build</code> from the following files
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>.html</code> files and md files on the top level (e.g. index.html Liquid template file on top level is converted to _site/index.html which contains only html markup)</li>
<li><code>.org</code> files from the <code>org</code> directory</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Hopefully this is of some use in starting to use a jekyll theme.
