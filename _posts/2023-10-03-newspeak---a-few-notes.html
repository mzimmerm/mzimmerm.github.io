<h4 id="orge88a74b"><span class="section-number-4">3.0.2.</span> Notation: In the text, how do we express a class name, a message (function, method) name, or a slot name?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-0-2">
<p>
This is a brief introduction to explain a notation used in this document.
</p>

<p>
Newspeak is a class based, and message based system.  All runtime operations are message sends (method calls).
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What do we mean by a 'message'?  Think of it as a method or function name with parameter names (method signature).</li>
<li>What do we mean by a 'message send'?  Think of it as calling (invoking) a method on an object.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In fact, we may use 'method name' and 'message name' interchangeably, although it is not quite precise.  We also may use the terms 'send a message', 'call a method' or 'invoke a method' interchangeably.
</p>

<p>
Here is the notation we want to introduce: When you see in text, something like <code>Rectangle&gt;&gt;#initWidth: width andHeight: height</code>, it means: "class <i>Rectangle</i> has a method named <i>initWith:andHeight</i>, with first parameter named <i>width</i> and second parameter named <i>height</i>". 
</p>

<p>
If you see just <code>#initWidth: width andHeight: height</code> it means the same as above, but we assume the class name "Rectangle" on which the method is declared, is clear from the context, and the meaning is same as above.
</p>

<p>
The parameter names are not part of the signature (a unique method name), and are often not included in the method signature.  If the parameter names are not included, we shorten the signature to <code>Rectangle&gt;&gt;#initWidth:andHeight:</code> or <code>#initWidth:andHeight:</code>.
</p>

<p>
Examples of this notation:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>Rectangle&gt;&gt;#initWidth width :andHeight: height</code></li>
<li><code>Rectangle&gt;&gt;#initWidth:andHeight:</code></li>
<li><code>#initWidth:andHeight:</code></li>
<li><code>#main: platform args: args</code></li>
<li><code>#usingPlatform: platform</code></li>
<li><code>Number&gt;&gt;squeared</code> - in this example, note there is not colon <code>:</code> at the end of the signature. The message <code>squared</code> is unary (does not accept a parameter) acts only on the Number instance, returning the squared value of the <code>Number</code> instance.</li>
<li><code>squared</code> - as above, but <code>Number</code> is clear from the context in the text.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<h4 id="org8bac09d"><span class="section-number-4">3.0.3.</span> Newspeak terminology</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-0-3">
<p>
Newspeak is different. Below we list terms that are generally used in documentation and in this document.  This section sort of jumps ahead of the gradual introduction to Newspeak, but should help when reading the text.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Top level class</b> : Class that appears on the top level class list in the IDE. Top level class has no enclosing class.</li>
<li><b>Module Declaration</b> : Source code of a top level class.</li>
<li><b>Module Definition</b> or <b>Module class</b> : The class object of a top level class.  This is the object that has the <i>primary factory method</i> defined below.</li>
<li><b>Module</b> :   Instance of a top level class. When talking about API, we sometimes use the term <i>module</i> instead of <i>module declaration</i>.</li>
<li><b>Slot</b> :  Equivalent of an instance variable (instance slot) or a local variable (local slot) in other languages. In Newspeak, everything is a message send, so a slot is a getter (immutable slot) or also a setter (mutable slot). Example:  <code>|mySlot =:: 1|</code> declares a mutable slot,  <code>|mySlot = 1|</code> declares an immutable slot. See the local and instance slot sections below for more details.</li>
<li><b>Instance slot declaration</b> : Name on the left of an expression between the bars <code>| |</code> located inside the <b>primary factory method</b>.  Instance slot is an <b>equivalent</b> of a member variable in other OO languages, and it's scope is the instance, with some small but important context differences due to class nesting. The slot name can have the symbol <code>=</code>, <code>=::</code> or nothing to the right of the slot name.  <code>|mySlot =:: 1|</code> is a declaration of a mutable slot named <code>mySlot</code>.  <code>|mySlot = 1|</code> is a declaration of an immutable slot named <code>mySlot</code> (in either example, initialized to <code>1</code> at the point of the declaration).  <code>|mySlot|</code>  is a declaration of an immutable slot, which can be initialized later in code. The <code>::</code> expresses mutability in Newspeak. Read it as 'the name on the left is set to the value on the right'.</li>
<li><b>Local slot declaration</b> : Similar to <i>instance slot declaration</i>, except the local slot is declared in (and its scope is) the body of an instance method or a factory method (but NOT in the primary factory method body, that is reserved for <b>instance slots</b>). Equivalent of a local variable in other languages.</li>
<li><p>
<b>Primary factory method</b> : The method that allows to accept parameters (capabilities), declare instance slots, and produce an instance of a class.  In practical terms, looking at code, the primary factory method is the method starting on the same line where the class code starts. Also, the <i>primary factory method</i> is the only place in which we can declare instance slots.  The 'class factory object' in code, is referenced using the uppercase class name. An example of a primary factory method named <code>#usingPlatform: p andA1: A1</code> on class <code>A2</code>:
</p>
<pre class="example" id="orgf524dd2">
(* The string "usingPlatform: andA1:" is the primary factory method signature.
   The primary factory method is declared as follows:
*)
class A2 usingPlatform: p andA1: A1 =
  (
    (* Section 1. Primary factory method slots and body.*)
    |slots|
    (* .. instantiation code here .. *)
  )
</pre>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Implementation detail: The 'primary factory method' is in fact a method on a "special" object, not a method on the class.  The class declaration above creates a "special" object termed 'class factory object' that provides the means of producing instances of the class. The 'class factory object' supports at least one message that produces new instances (of the class). This message on the 'class factory object' is the 'primary factory method'.  But for practical purposes, we can think of the 'primary factory method' as a class method that produces instances of a class.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So code such as <code>AMyApp packageUsing: manifest</code> invokes the factory method <code>#packageUsing</code> on the 'class factory object' ALSO named <code>AMyApp</code>, and it produces an instance of the <code>class AMyApp</code>.  We can use use it to store the produced instance in code such as <code>myAppInstance:: AMyApp packageUsing: manifest</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<b>Factory method</b> : The method that produces an instance but cannot declare instance slots.  Note the distinction from <i>primary factory method</i> above.  In practical terms, looking at code, <i>factory method</i> is the method in the class code section after the ":" - in this example, in section 3.  Below is an example of <i>factory method</i> named <code>#factoryMethod1</code> on class <code>A2</code>:  
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org3c78e0b">
class A2 usingPlatform: p andA1: A1 =
  (
    (* Section 1. Primary factory method slots and body. *)
    |slots|
    (* .. instantiation code here .. *)
  )
  (
    (* Section 2. instance methods and nested classes *)
  )
  :
  (
    (* Section 3. factory methods *)
    factoryMethod1 = ( (* Code returning instance, but cannot declare slots. *) )
  )
</pre></li>
<li><b>Class factory object</b> : The user accessible object that represents the class in the language. This object provides the factory methods (both primary factory methods and factory methods). From user's perspective, the <b>class factory object</b>, <b>class object</b>, and <b>class</b> are all informal names for the same thing!  This is slightly different for the language implementor, for whom the class factory object is distinct from the class - see the section below.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Note on the terms <b>factory method</b>, <b>primary factory method</b> and <b>constructor</b>.  
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Readers familiar with object oriented languages can think of the term "factory method" as "constructor". (The short term "factory" is sometimes used instead of the term "factory method").</li>
<li>The Newspeak term "primary factory method" may not exist in other OO languages, but it is very important in Newspeak, as it is the only method that can declare instance slots.  A Newspeak class must have exactly one "primary factory method".</li>
<li>While the role of a "primary factory method" in Newspeak is similar to "constructor", Newspeak intentionally chooses to avoid the name "constructor" for several reasons.  Perhaps the core reason is that "constructor" suggests constructing (creating) something, which is not always a correct connotation.  For example, a constructor may return an existing object from a cache, for which the name is misleading.  Hence, Newspeak uses the term <b>factory method</b> (<b>factory</b> in brief) instead of the term <b>constructor</b>.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="org3898334"><span class="section-number-5">3.0.3.1.</span> Terminology differences for language user vs. language implementor</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-3-0-3-1">
<p>
In a language implementation, there is likely a representation of the <b>class</b>, that probably points to a mixin and a superclass. For the language implementor, this representation of <b>class</b> is called a <b>class factory object</b>. This object is distinct, from the <span class="underline">user accessible object that represents the <b>class</b> in the language</span>. So the term <b>class factory object</b> is used to distinguish it from the <b>class</b> itself, but that is a distinction for the implementor, not the user.
</p>

<p>
Informally, when speaking from the language user's perspective, we often refer to this user accessible object as the <b>class</b>, or the <b>class object</b>, or the <b>class factory object</b> (all names for the same thing). 
</p>

<p>
So I suppose when talking about the language, we should use the term "class" or perhaps "class object" for this thing.

<h2 id="org427308f"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Perhaps the best high level summary of Newspeak</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
For me it is this article's summary is perhaps the best high level summary of Newspeak:  <a href="https://bracha.org/newspeak-modules.pdf">Modules as Objects in Newspeak</a>. Let me paste it here removing references that would not make sense in another context:
</p>

<p>
<i>Like Self, all computation - even an object's own access to its internal structure  is performed by invoking methods on objects. Newspeak is class-based. Classes can be nested arbitrarily. Since all names denote method invocations, all classes are virtual; in particular, superclasses are virtual, so all classes act as mixins. Unlike its predecessors, there is no static state in Newspeak, nor is there a global namespace. Modularity in Newspeak is based exclusively on class nesting. There are no separate modularity constructs such as packages. Top level classes act as module definitions, which are independent, immutable, self-contained parametric namespaces. They can be instantiated into modules which may be stateful and mutually recursive.</i>
</p>

<p>
This is a beautiful summary. But it is also not easy to "visualize" how is this tranfered to practice in Newspeak.
</p>

<p>
This document is both a personal experience of learning Newspeak, an an attempt of making sense of the practical ways the above text means for a Newspeak user.

A spoiler: we can look ahead and run the app we will be building - the <code>CounterApp</code> - online at <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel</a>.

TL;DR: This section introduces the online version of Newspeak IDE, and how to use it.
</p>

<p>
This is a brief section.  Starting with Newspeak is easy.  We just point the browser to <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a>.
</p>

<p>
In more detail, let us try the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Action: In a new browser tab, open the Newspeak online IDE at <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a></li>
<li>Result: The Newspeak IDE opens, similar to
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-newspeak-ide-start.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Action: To edit source code: Click the "Newspeak Source" link
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-go-to-newspeak-source.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Result: A new page opens, showing Newspeak classes, similar to
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-newspeak-source.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Note: The blue links are classes.  To view, or change them, click the class link</li>
<li>Action: Click the "+" beside the "Root" to add a class.</li>
<li>Result: A class editor opens, with a template of a new class declaration (class source code; the IDE uses the term class definition).  At first, let's just create a dummy class by editing the template
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-newspeak-source-defining-a-new-class.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Action: Click the checkbox on the top right <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-accept-image.png" alt="nil"/> to "Accept" the new class declaration.  Note: Clicking the "Accept" button is important.  If you make any code changes, or workspace code changes, do not forget to click "Accept", otherwise your changes will be lost immediately after moving away from the source editing page.  See the discussions in <a href="#org5e01071">Chapter Saving changes in Newspeak</a>.</li>

<li>Result: The class now appears in the list of classes (may need to scroll down, classes are sorted alphabetically)
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-my-new-class-now-added.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Action: Return back to the main page by pressing the browser "Back" button, to get back to
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-newspeak-ide-start.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>To run some Newspeak expressions, click the "Workspaces" link
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-go-to-workspaces.png" alt="nil"/>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Result: A new page opens, similar to
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-workspaces.png" alt="nil"/></li>
</ul></li>
<li>To run some simple one-liner code, type for example "1+2" into the text field, and press keyboard <b>Shift + ENTER</b>.  This will evaluate the expression and print a result "3"
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Result: expression "1+2" was evaluated to "3"
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-workspaces-expression.png" alt="nil"/></li>
</ul></li>
<li>To run multi-line Newspeak code, type the code line by line.  Press keyboard <b>ENTER</b> to open new lines.  When ready to run the code, <b>highlight all lines, then press keyboard Shift + ENTER</b> to run the code.  Another term for running code like this, is "evaluating all highlighted lines".  The image below shows the Workspace after the <b>Shift + ENTER</b> was pressed, showing the evaluated code, and the result of the evaluated code: <code>2</code>.
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-workspaces-multiline-expression.png" alt="nil"/>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The image above uses a white-mode image, as the dark-mode pages do not show highlight too well.</li>
<li>When running multi-line code, we can paste it from outside, instead of typing it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To save our changes "now", click the diskette "Save" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-save-button.png" alt="nil"/>.  The changes are saved in the browser local storage.  See Notes below for discussion on the details.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Notes:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We are now using Newspeak, in its full power.</li>
<li>The browser tab opened on <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a> IS the Newspeak live IDE.</li>
<li>Everything we do in the IDE is alive, changes and actions have immediate responses in the running system.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Saving your changes:
</p>

<p>
<b>Any changes we make (for example: we add a class, we change a class, evaluate something in the workspace) are stored in the browser local storage in two entries: "lastSaved" and "backup".</b> The "Accept" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-accept-image.png" alt="nil"/> saves the changes in local storage under the key "backup", while the "Save" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-save-button.png" alt="nil"/>, saves the changes under the key "lastSaved".  See <a href="#org5e01071">Chapter Saving changes in Newspeak</a> for details.

</ul>

<p>
Summary:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This section showed the simplest way of starting with Newspeak - we just point the browser to <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a> and start using it.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In "Workspaces", we can experiment with Newspeak expressions, or snippets of code.</li>
<li>In "Newspeak Source", we can experiment with adding Newspeak classes, or creating a Newspeak app, such as the app created in the next section.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Potential "gotchas":
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you make code changes, do not forget to click the "Accept" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-accept-image.png" alt="nil"/>.  Otherwise your changes will be lost immediately after moving away from the source editing page.</li>
<li>What is the difference between The "Save" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-save-button.png" alt="nil"/>, and the "Accept" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-accept-image.png" alt="nil"/>? 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The "Accept" button is needed to save your changes beyond moving away from the editor.  For example, if you make a change to a class method, and do not click "Accept", your changes will be lost after pressing the browser "Back" button, browser "Reload" - generally any state changes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

Next:
</p>

<p>
In the next section we show how to create a simple <code>CounterApp</code> in Newspeak.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgff12272" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgff12272"><span class="section-number-3">5.2.</span> Code, run, and debug the CounterApp in Newspeak</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
TL;DR: This section describes coding, running, and deploying a Newspeak Application with UI. We name the Application <code>CounterApp</code>. <code>CounterApp</code> is also the name of one of it's top level classes.  To concentrate on the IDE handling applications, we use pre-existing code for the <code>CounterApp</code>, provided in  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeak/master/CounterUI.ns">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeak/master/CounterUI.ns</a>, and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeak/master/CounterApp.ns">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeak/master/CounterApp.ns</a>.  To skip the coding details above, we can download, then <a href="#org519fcbe">"Compile file(s)"</a> to load the fully finished code from there; the loaded classes will appear in the IDE. Then we can browse, run, or deploy the Application.  It's running UI looks like this: <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-counter-app-running.png" alt="nil"/>
</p>

<p>
Prerequisites:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We will simply borrow the code without talking about it until later.  Download the files <code>CounterApp.ns</code> and <code>CounterUI.ns</code> from Github to the local filesystem.  To do that, just click <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeak/master/CounterUI.ns">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeak/master/CounterUI.ns</a>, then <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeak/master/CounterApp.ns">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeak/master/CounterApp.ns</a>, then right-click and select "Save as&#x2026;" to save each file.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Either way, note the location of the two files.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>
Notes: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We deploy the <code>CounterApp</code>, in this section using the online Newspeak at <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a></li>
<li>However, a local Newspeak webserver could be used instead.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If we wanted to deploy the <code>CounterApp</code> in "production", we would need a local Newspeak server - because there is no way to deploy the app to the online Newspeak site.</li>
<li>Deployment of the  <code>CounterApp</code> to "production" requires our "own" Newspeak, such as the local Newspeak webserver.  See <a href="#orga40f49a">5.3</a> for how to install Newspeak locally.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We may ask, "what is an Application in Newspeak"? In a nutshell, an "Application" is an instance of a class - obviously.  But which class, and what does the class need, to be able to "live" or "run" inside a Newspeak IDE or Newspeak runtime? Read the steps below for details.</li>

<h4 id="orgaab01b3"><span class="section-number-4">5.2.1.</span> Steps: To create and run the <code>CounterApp</code> (from existing code that we borrowed from Github), follow the Action/Result steps below:</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-2-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Action: In a new browser tab, open the online Newspeak IDE at <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a></li>
<li>Result: The Newspeak IDE opens, similar to <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-newspeak-ide-start.png" alt="nil"/>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Note: The "Did you know" section is a ever-changing hint system</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Action: Click "Newspeak Source" in <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-go-to-newspeak-source.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Result: A new page opens, showing Newspeak classes, similar to <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-newspeak-source.png" alt="nil"/>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Note on the result: In the result, you should NOT see classes named <code>CounterApp</code> or <code>CounterUI</code>.  If you do, you have most likely run through this tutorial before, and the classes are already in your browser local storage.  To clean any local changes saved locally for the online Newspeak, you can clean them in the browser local storage, or click the 3-dot on the class line, and Remove the class.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Motivation for the next action: We want to build the sample app <code>CounterApp</code>.  We choose to build it simply by downloading and compiling existing source files in the Newspeak github repo.</b></li>
<li>Action:  <a id="org519fcbe"></a> In the top right of the page (in the same line where we see "Root +") <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-3-vertical-dots.png" alt="nil"/>, click the <b>vertical 3-dot</b> button on the far right.</li>
<li>Result: A popup  <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-compile-files.png" alt="nil"/> shows</li>

<li>Action: Click "Compile File(s)".  This will ask us to select files stored on disk, and compile them.</li>
<li>Result: OS file browser opens, and ask us to select files in the operating system file browser.</li>
<li>Action: Navigate to the directory where we checked out the Newspeak github repo, OR where we saved the source for the <code>.ns</code> files (see Prerequisites of this section).  Select <code>CounterApp.ns</code> and <code>CounterUI.ns</code></li>
<li>Result: <b>The classes from the selected <code>.ns</code> files compile, and show in your IDE.</b> In your class list (the list under Root +), you should now see a section similar to this <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-counter-classes.png" alt="nil"/>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Note 1: We have loaded the code of the  <code>CounterApp.ns</code> and
<code>CounterUI.ns</code> classes into Newspeak by running "Compile
file".  Alternatively, we could have added the classes through the IDE by
clicking the "Root-+" button
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-root-plus-button.png" alt="nil"/> and typing or pasting the code in.
Instead, we choose to load pre-existing files at the moment to concentrate on the process, not the code.</li>
<li>Note 2: click the <code>CounterApp</code> or <code>CounterUI</code> link.  This shows the corresponding class.</li>
<li>Note 3: The <code>CounterApp</code> shows links to <code>[deploy] [configuration] [run] [debug]</code>.  Why do only the "app" classes such as <code>CounterApp</code> (and no other classes) show the <code>[deploy] [configuration] [run] [debug]</code> links in the Newspeak IDE? The IDE decides to show those links based on the presence of a convention method <code>#packageUsing: manifest</code>.  See <a href="#org5ca8807">Newspeak modules API summary</a> for what makes a module an App, a Library, or a TestConfiguration, and how the IDE handles the API.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Action: To save the classes we added, (<code>CounterApp</code> or <code>CounterUI</code>) in the browser local storage explicitly "now", click the diskette "Save" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-save-button.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Result: The two classes are stored in the browser local storage.  To read more about details of the browser local storage, see <a href="#org5e01071">Chapter Saving changes in Newspeak</a>.</li>
<li>Action: click the <b>[run]</b> link beside the  <code>CounterApp</code>.  This runs the code in the app (specifically, the <code>CounterUI</code> code).</li>
<li>Result: The counter app opens and runs in the same browser tab; it should look like this:  <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-counter-app-running.png" alt="nil"/> The code presents a counter (integer), and 3 buttons, which actions are to "increment", "decrement" and "reset" the counter.</li>
<li>Action: click "increment"</li>
<li>Result: counter increments by one.</li>
<li>Note: We can click [debug] instead of [run] and a debugger will open.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Summary: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We have shown how to code, run, and debug, a Newspeak app <code>CounterApp</code> in "development mode", inside the online Newspeak IDE.</li>
<li>Newspeak online is similar to (but we dare say superior to) running, in "development mode", a Java, Android or Flutter application in IntelliJ, Eclipse, Visual Studio, Atom, Emacs, vi, or any IDE.</li>
<li>Your changes are always stored, as long as you "Accept".  See <a href="#org5e01071">Chapter Saving changes in Newspeak</a> for saving changes details.</li>

<li>How to download, install, and start a <b>local Newspeak webserver</b>.</li>

<li>How opening a browser tab at <a href="http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a> runs the local version of the Newspeak IDE (reaching the just installed local Newspeak webserver).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Prerequisites: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Python is installed on your system.  This is needed for the <code>serve.sh</code> script to run an HTTP server.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Notes: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can use a server of your choice instead of the Python server needed by <code>serve.sh</code>.  Just place all the files downloaded in the sections below to your server's serving directory.</li>
<li>You can potentially skip this section.  However, if you want to deploy a Newspeak app such as the <code>CounterApp</code>, this section is needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Action steps to download, install, and start using a local Newspeak webserver</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First, you may want to review the Newspeak downloads page at <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/downloads.html">https://newspeaklanguage.org/downloads.html</a>, in particular the <b>For all platforms</b> link.</li>

<li>Next, to install and start a local Newspeak webserver, you can 

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Either download and unzip the file <b>servable.zip</b> from the link above (<a href="https://github.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeaklanguage.github.io/raw/master/servable.zip">https://github.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeaklanguage.github.io/raw/master/servable.zip</a>) to any directory, then start the Newspeak server by running <code>serve.sh</code> from the extracted file.</li>

<li><p>
Or run the following commands from the command line (this assumes your directory from which Newspeak is served is <code>$HOME/software/newspeak/my-serve-http</code>:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell"><span style="color: #fcaf3e;">MY_SERVE_NEWSPEAK</span>=$<span style="color: #fcaf3e;">HOME</span>/software/newspeak/my-serve-http
mkdir --parent $<span style="color: #fcaf3e;">MY_SERVE_NEWSPEAK</span> || <span style="color: #e090d7;">echo</span> Unable to create directory $<span style="color: #fcaf3e;">MY_SERVE_NEWSPEAK</span> 
<span style="color: #e090d7;">cd</span> $<span style="color: #fcaf3e;">MY_SERVE_NEWSPEAK</span>
curl --location https://github.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeaklanguage.github.io/raw/master/servable.zip --output $<span style="color: #fcaf3e;">MY_SERVE_NEWSPEAK</span>/servable.zip
unzip -o servable.zip

<span style="color: #73d216;"># </span><span style="color: #73d216;">The directory just above "servable" must be the directory</span>
<span style="color: #73d216;"># </span><span style="color: #73d216;">where we saved the zip file, see above.</span>

<span style="color: #e090d7;">cd</span> servable
<span style="color: #73d216;"># </span><span style="color: #73d216;">Make serve.sh executable, and start the Newspeak local server.</span>
chmod u+x serve.sh
./serve.sh
</pre>
</div></li>
</ul></li>

<li>Expected Result: "serving at port 8080".  Note: In <b>servable.zip</b> there is a file <code>server.py</code>, which defines the Newspeak server port.  The port is set to 8080.  Edit the file and change port if needed.</li>
</ul>


<p>
To use the local Newspeak webserver, navigate browser to <a href="http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a>.  This should open the locally hosted Newspeak IDE, started using the <code>./serve.sh</code> command. 
</p>

<p>
Your browser should show a page similar to 
  <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-local-ide.png" alt="nil"/>
</p>

<p>
Note: The use of the local version is the same as the use of the online version.  We can now start editing Newspeak code by clicking on the "Newspeak Source" link.

<p>
TL;DR: This section describes 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How to create and deploy the <code>CounterApp</code> into the local version of Newspeak.</li>
<li>That the deployment is achieved by creating a deployable file, <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code>, in the online Newspeak at <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a> and placing the created <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code> in the running local Newspeak webserver.</li>
<li>How to run the <code>CounterApp</code> from the local Newspeak webserver, by accessing the  <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code> from the local HTTP server.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Prerequisites: 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>We have followed the online section <a href="#orgff12272">5.2</a>.  In that section, we have downloaded (from Newspeak Github) and compiled two classes <code>CounterApp</code> and <code>CounterUI</code> <b>while attached to the online Newspeak</b>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This statement requires a "fine point" explanation. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In the earlier section  <a href="#orgff12272">5.2</a>, the two classes, <code>CounterApp</code> and <code>CounterUI</code>, were saved to the browser local storage.</li>
<li>In this current section, we re-attach to online Newspeak at <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a>.</li>
<li>As explained in <a href="#org5e01071">Chapter Saving changes in Newspeak</a>, the changes we made in the online version are still stored locally in the browser local storage.</li>
<li>So, when we re-attach to online Newspeak in this section, the classes <code>CounterApp</code> and <code>CounterUI</code> are still available.  We use them to "create the CounterApp" (by saving it "as victory fuel" - that is, as file <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code>) which is the app.</li>
<li>This app - the  file <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code> - can then be copied to the serving directory of local Newspeak, and can be opened from there.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>We have installed the local version of Newspeak by following the section <a href="#orga40f49a">5.3</a>.*</li>
</ol>


<p>
Notes: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We will create the deployable file, <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code> using the online Newspeak at <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a></li>

One more "fine point" note:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This flipping between the online Newspeak and local Newspeak could be confusing.  We could have started by downloading Newspeak locally, and follow the whole tutorial in local Newspeak.

</ul>


<p>
<b>Steps: <a id="org96bf37e"></a> Now we have introduced the context, we start the core of this section: We create the deployable file, <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code> and deploy it to the local Newspeak, by following the Action/Result steps below:</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Action: Navigate to the online version of Newspeak at <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a> and click the "Newspeak Source"</li>
<li>Result: Under "Root" you should see an alphabetically organized list of classes, similar to <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-newspeak-source.png" alt="nil"/>, 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Note: If you followed the online section <a href="#orgff12272">5.2</a>, there should be <code>CounterApp</code> and <code>CounterUI</code> classes in the alphabetic list.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Action: In the class list, find the <code>CounterApp</code>, and click the [deploy] to the right of the "CounterApp"</li>
<li>Result: a popup showing deployment options, starting with <code>asVictoryFuel</code>: <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-click-deploy-on-counter-app.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Action: Select <code>asVictoryFuelWithMirrors</code>.  We choose the option 'asVictoryFuelWithMirrors' if our app uses the GUI (there's some mirror dependency in the UI) and 'asVictoryFuel' otherwise.</li>
<li>Result: After a long wait, a file named <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code> is created, and asked to be saved.</li>
<li>Action: Save the file <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code> on our disk to the directory where local Newspeak was deployed - for example <code>$HOME/software/newspeak/my-serve-http/servable</code></li>
<li>Result: <b>The counter app is now deployed to the local Newspeak webserver!</b></li>
</ul>


<p>
To prove the counter app is now deployed to the local Newspeak webserver, do the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Action: Open a new browser tab, and navigate to the just saved application  <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code> in the local Newspeak webserver as <a href="http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel">http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel</a></li>
<li>Result: In the new tab, you should see the "locally deployed" <code>CounterApp</code> is now running
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-counter-app-local-run.png" alt="nil"/></li>
</ul>

<p>
Summary: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In this section, using the online Newspeak, we built our "Newspeak production deployable" file <code>CounterApp.vfuel</code>, and deployed it to the local Newspeak version at <a href="http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel">http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel</a>.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">
<p>
On this journey, I would like to walk back and capture some of my surprises, gotchas, but also amazement of simplicity during a journey of my first week (stretched over 2 months) starting with Newspeak.  But hopefully I manage to organize this journey into a somewhat streamlined story.  Actually "the first week" is not completely correct.  I did first discover Newspeak long time ago, almost when it started, read available articles back then, and covered the syntax which helped.  But I did not have time back then to get my hands on it properly.
</p>

<p>
Most learning, and often "unlearning" for me was the discovery different the Newspeak platform is, compared to most mainstream platforms, such as Java, Python, C++, even Smalltalk (with Smalltalk, Newspeak shares syntax and extreme late boundedness).
</p>

<p>
At this moment I should give readers some links to jump off here and do this alone.  If you found this, you probably already searched to learn about Newspeak.  But I hope, if you get back here after googling and reading the links, the rest of this text may still be helpful :) ..  so, some selected links:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First of all, the home of the Newspeak language <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/">https://newspeaklanguage.org/</a> has links to all documentation, videos, installers and more.</li>
<li>Second, to run Newspeak online, navigate to  <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel</a>.</li>
<li>Next, if I was to:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>recommend selected few documents, it could be
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://bracha.org/newspeak.pdf">The Newspeak programming platform</a>, an older document, briefly introduces both the syntax, and the core principles of Newspeak.</li>
<li><a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/Literate/Literate.html">Newspeak by example</a>  which is a live document, introduces the syntax of Newspeak, sort of a Jupyter notebook for Newspeak: reader can type and evaluate Newspeak expression in a web page, interleaved with document text.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>recommend a hands-on Newspeak introduction, it could be
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Either use (still relevant where not Squeak dependent) <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/ns101/ns101.html">Newspeak on Squeak - A Guide for the Perplexed</a></li>
<li>Or follow the hands-on section <a href="#org10773d9">Newspeak: A quickstart.  Explore the IDE.  Then develop CounterApp, package it and deploy it</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Getting back to my first week journey; it is unfair to hikers, as my journey was at times, that of a wanderer almost lost in a forest; haphazardly reading all I can get my hands on, trying code snippets things in the IDE, re-tracing running and deploying the existing <code>CounterApp</code>, and overall, taking one step forward, then two steps back as the step forward discovered more unknowns.
</p>

<p>
Some concrete talk please!
</p>

<p>
OK.  But first one more paragraph of meta-talk.  Just a heads up, I will start using the word <b>platform</b> a lot.  Let me try explain what I mean by <i>platform</i> or <i>language platform</i>.  Often we think of learning a "computer language" as learning its syntax.  But syntax is only a small part of being able to be productive in the language.  There are all those things around the syntax, that are needed to be comfortable and productive with a "computer language": How is it installed, how we create projects to start writing a useful program, the core idioms, how to use programs written by other people in that language (the libraries), how the programs we write are packaged and send to users to use (building, packaging and installing apps), how to secure the resulting program.  It is all these things listed in the long sentence that I mean by the "language platform" or "platform". 
</p>

<p>
Newspeak syntax is not a major obstacle.  Well, it is quite different too, even for someone knowing Smalltalk, which Newspeak shares syntax with.  But one can get syntax basics from the links above.  Also, Newspeak syntax is a bit like speaking English.  Just different from the mainstream.  I will not address syntax too much here.
</p>

<p>
Newspeak is a principled language and <b>platform</b> (in the sense described).  Gilad Bracha and collaborating authors describe several principles (adherence to which removes many mainstream platforms' weaknesses).  Those principles are described in the above linked paper <a href="http://bracha.org/newspeak.pdf">The Newspeak programming platform</a> and other documents.
</p>

<p>
As this section title states, Newspeak is different. <b>Being different is not for fun.  Newspeak must be different to implement its core principles</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Dynamicity</li>
<li>Modularity (including how dependencies are provided)</li>
<li>Classes can be nested (nesting provides the core of modularity)</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Reflectivity</li>
<li>intentional lack of static state</li>
<li>support for both object-oriented and functional styles</li>
<li>the only operation is a message send</li>
</ul>


<p>
I will add one multi-item principle.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Everything in the Newspeak language is an object (instance of a class). 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most(?) mainstream languages use separate concepts for packages, apps, modules, namespaces, classes.  They also use the filesystem a lot.</li>
<li>All concepts in the item above exist in Newspeak, but they are all implemented by objects.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
But, given a Newspeak object, how do we know it is a <b>module, a library, or an application</b>? The distinction between them is determined by:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the object's position in the class nesting and</li>
<li>presence of certain API (convention methods such as <code>#main:platform args:args</code>. This is discussed in <a href="#org5ca8807">Newspeak modules API summary</a> and other sections leading to it.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Given a Newspeak object, how does it acquire it's dependencies (objects it depends on to be functional)? This is one core point discussed at length in this text. See <a href="#org24da67d">Dependencies and modularity: Important but hard to "get" at first</a> the links therein, and sections afer.
</p>

<p>
"Being different" does came at a steep initial learning curve (for me at least).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-2">
<p>
This section is only a quick "look ahead summary" to provide more motivation and contex for the rest of the parent chapter.
</p>

<p>
Due to Newspeak's modularity, the process of bringing dependencies into a Newspeak program is different from mainstream language platforms. Because of it, large parts of this text deals with the topic of dependencies. 
</p>

<p>
As a look ahead summary we can say that 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Every computation in Newspeak starts at an instance of a top level class. Instances of top level classes are called modules.</li>
<li>Modules can be packaged and distributed.</li>
<li>Dependencies are also modules (which some distributed module depends on).</li>
<li>The <code>manifest</code> and <code>platform</code> objects are the vehicles of bringing dependencies to objects at runtime by passing them to modules' "convention methods".</li>
<li>From modules, the dependencies are also available to the distributed module's nested classes and objects.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Later sections decribe the process of bringing dependencies into a Newspeak programs. We use the <i>manifest</i> passed to module APIs, from the manifest, dependency classes are stored on slots ("imported"), later picked up from slots when needed to instantiate.  <a href="#org4ad2904">Modules: Application, Library, TestConfiguration, General</a>, the recipy section <a href="#orgea7e696">Newspeak recipy for writing modules API</a>, and the <a href="#org4bd3b5c">Hello World in Newspeak - several versions</a> and other sections are largely about bringing dependencies into modules and objects.

<p>
To do anything useful with Newspeak, we have to use the IDE.  There is no command line per se (there is, but it is inside the IDE.  It is called the Workspace).  So let us open the Newspeak IDE to look around.  Navigate to  <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=CounterApp.vfuel</a>.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-4-1">
<p>
Top level classes in the IDE are crucial because their instances are Newspeak modules. A Module can play a role of an Application or Library.
</p>

<p>
I the IDE, click on the "Newspeak Source" button. We see the word <b>Root</b> on top left, and below, a list of class names. 
</p>

<p><img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-ide-full-page-classes-collapsed.png" alt="nil"/>
</p>
</div>

<p>
First: what is the "Root" on the top? According to documentation, this is the IDE's top namespace - <i>Root</i> is the name of the  namespace.
</p>

<p>
In Newspeak, each class in the screenshot above (AccessModifierTesting, and below) is called a <b>top level class</b>, and it belongs to the <i>Root namespace of the IDE</i>.  Each <i>instance of a top level class</i> is referred to as a <b>module</b>, see <a href="#org0bf4fc9">Discussion of Modules</a>.  
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org0bf4fc9" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0bf4fc9"><span class="section-number-4">6.4.2.</span> Discussion of Modules</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-4-2">
<p>
In software in general, <i>Modules</i> are related to namespaces in a way that we cannot precisely define here.  See <a href="#org2d6eaf3">Discussion of Namespaces</a> as well.  But we can say this about modules: Modules are meant to be artifacts providing some useful non trivial functionality, without needing any help - apart from the help of "dependencies" - that is, help of other modules intended to provide some "sub functionality".  There must be a way to package and distribute modules.
</p>

<p>
In Newspeak, modularity is one of the key concepts. Modules, the key constructs of modularity, are based on class nesting.
</p>

<p>
Lets again quote from <a href="https://bracha.org/newspeak-modules.pdf">Modules as Objects in Newspeak</a>: 
</p>

<p>
<i>In Newspeak, nor is there a global namespace. Modularity in Newspeak is based exclusively on class nesting. There are no separate modularity constructs such as packages. Top level classes act as module definitions, which are independent, immutable, self-contained parametric namespaces. They can be instantiated into modules which may be stateful and mutually recursive.</i>
</p>

<p>
Newspeak uses the following definitions (from the section <a href="#org8bac09d">Newspeak terminology</a>):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b><i>Module declaration</i></b> is the source code of any top level class</li>
<li><b><i>Module definition</i></b> or <b><i>Module class</i></b> is any <b><i>top level class object</i></b>.  We will use the terms interchangeably depending on context.</li>
<li><b><i>Module</i></b> or <b><i>Newspeak module</i></b> is an <b><i>instance of any top level class</i></b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So, an instance of any class shown on the top level in the IDE is a <i>module</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>Newspeak Module</i> is not only an empty new term.  It turns out, that, by nesting other classes, <i>modules</i> also satisfy what we normally want from software modules: they are self-contained elements of data and functionality which can be distributed or executed, given expected API.</b>  To understand more about how expected API determines a module's role, see <a href="#org5ca8807">Newspeak modules API summary</a>. In addition, <i>Newspeak modules</i> cannot cross-access each other when deployed - unless one module explicitly requests another <i>module</i> or <i>module class</i> during packaging and building.  
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org2d6eaf3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org2d6eaf3"><span class="section-number-4">6.4.3.</span> Discussion of Namespaces</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-4-3">
<p>
<i>Namespaces</i> in softwware in general provide grouping and organization of artifacts used in programs (packages, classes, or functions).  A Java namespace example would be "org.mypackage".  All classes in that package belong to the namespace "org.mypackage".  Python concept of a package is similar. 
</p>

<p>
Most platforms and languages have a concept and need for a <b>global namespace</b>. How can we describe it? Perhaps a good high level description of a <i>global namespace</i> would go like this: In a program, we want to use other programs, classes, functions, or what have you, created by other developers, at compile time or runtime, depending on the platform.  If our Java program is in the "org.mypackage" and a class "org.mypackage.MyClass wants to use "org.apache.SomeClass", then at compile time or at runtime, the platform (Java, but e.g.  Python is equivalent) has to find "org.apache.SomeClass".  How does it do that? By looking through CLASSPATH or PYTHONPATH.  The CLASSPATH or PYTHONPATH play the role of the <i>global namespace</i>!  All other namespaces, such as "org.apache" belong to the <i>global namespace</i>.  In a Java or Python program, any class and it's instance at runtime has access to artifacts on the CLASSPATH or PYTHONPATH. For example, this code
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #73d216;">// </span><span style="color: #73d216;">In org.mypackage.MyClass: </span>
<span style="color: #8cc4ff;">Object</span> <span style="color: #fcaf3e;">newObject</span> = Class.forName(<span style="color: #e9b96e;">"org.apache.SomeClass"</span>).newInstance();
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Creates an instance of "org.apache.SomeClass" at runtime by finding it on CLASSPATH - on the <i>global namespace</i> of Java. As long as the classloader can find "org.apache.SomeClass" on the CLASSPATH, and SomeClass has the default constructor, an instance can be created - without "org.apache.SomeClass" ever being imported to the code. Instances of classes in "org.mypackage" can create instances of classes in "org.apache" and vice versa, without importing each other.  <b>This is why the availability of the <i>global namespace</i> harms modularity, as it enables "hidden dependencies" like the one described in this short Java example!</b> 
</p>

<p>
The Newspeak language does not have a <i>global namespace</i> but the Newspeak IDE does have a <i>global namespace</i> - the <i>Root</i> on top of the IDE we have seen in the previous chapter. There is some discussion regarding why that is in <a href="#org80c2e8f">Namespaces and existence of global namespace in the IDE</a>.
</p>

<p>
The consequence of <i>no global namespace in the language</i> is that, at runtime (outside of IDE), a Newspeak module class must declare it's dependency on another module class (or module) explicitly, by storing the dependency module definition (or dependency module) on it's module slot! This storing of a dependency on a slot can be looked at as "importing" the dependency. Example of code where showing all classes needed at runtime are "imported" by holding on to them on module slots:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In <a href="#org665fb74">4. Hello World Application using 3rd party dependency</a> the <code>HelloTranslatorLib</code> holds on to the <code>HelloTranslator</code></li>
<li>In <a href="#org2852d73">4. Application module: API of module that needs to be distributed as an App</a> <code>RecipyWithDepApp</code> holds on to the <code>RecipyWithDep</code>, and <code>RecipyNoDep</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>The dependency management goes deeper: A distributable module (Application or Library object), when instantiated and serialized on the source system, 'carries along', ALL imported dependencies on it's module slots - classes or instances of other classes from it's slots. After deserialization on the target system, it has all the code and objects it needs to work on the target system. (The Platform object is an exception: it is assumed to exist on both the source the target platform with same API, and it is not a part of the serialized artifact.)</b>
</p>

<h4 id="org80c2e8f"><span class="section-number-4">6.4.4.</span> Namespaces and existence of global namespace in the IDE</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-4-4">
<p>
The existence of the <i>Root namespace</i> in the Newspeak IDE describes one of my surprises - although I realized only later that I should be surprised.  I should have been surprised because there are many places in the Newspeak documentation describing that "Newspeak has no global namespace".  So I was wondering why this "Root", is not a global namespace? Turns out that it is! But there is an important distinction, <i>the Newspeak <b>language</b> does not have a global namespace while the Newspeak <b>IDE</b> does - it's name is "Root"</i>.
</p>

<p>
Next we can ask, why does the Newspeak IDE need a global namespace (Root), while the Newspeak language does not have one, in fact very intentionally does not have one?  The reason is, when working in the IDE, we want cross-access between the <i>module classes</i> (the <i>top level classes</i>).  At runtime, that is, after packaging and deployment of any Newspeak module (outside the IDE), only the modules intended to be used by other modules should be available!  Modules cannot freely cross-use each other, because there is no global namespace to find each other (or each other's class).  If a moduleA needs to use moduleB, moduleA must explicitly ask to include moduleB's definition (the class of moduleB) at the packaging stage.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-5-3">
<p>
First, we can see, each top level class has 4 sections.  Let's take the ActivationMirrorTestingConfiguration as an example
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A collapsible class name section for the class, <code>ActivationMirrorTestingConfiguration</code> with two sub items
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>on top the <code>#packageTestsUsing: manifest</code>.  This is a method which can be viewed as the "core" or "primary" constructor.  In Newspeak, the method is called the <b>Primary factory</b>.</li>
<li>a list of <code>Slots</code>.  Slots are like "member variables".  Slots can only be created in the <i>primary factory method</i>!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>a list of <code>Classes</code>.  Those are nested classes of the class ActivationMirrorTestingConfiguration</li>
<li>a list of <code>Instance methods</code>.  Those are instance methods we can call on instances of ActivationMirrorTestingConfiguration</li>
<li>a list of <code>Class methods</code>.  Those are class methods we can call on the class ActivationMirrorTestingConfiguration.  They are "alternative constructors".</li>
</ol>

<p>
There is a plus ("+ ") symbol  in the header of some of them.  The reason there is no plus ("+ ") symbol beside slots, is that slots can only be added in the code of the <i>primary factory method</i>.  Add a slot from the  <i>primary factory method</i> code, and the added slot name will show in the IDE.

We mentioned the methods on the first line of the class declaration such as <code>class MyClass packageTestsUsing: manifest</code> are termed the <i>primary factory methods</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>The core role of a <i>primary factory method</i> is to produce instances (and declare and initialize their slots). The difference between a <i>primary factory method</i> and a <i>factory method</i> or an <i>instance method</i> is that ONLY <i>primary factory method</i> can declare in initialize slots!</b>
</p>

<p>
Newspeak language implementation detail: We also mentioned that the <i>primary factory methods</i> are methods on special objects, the 'class factory object'(s).  One such special object is created for each class declaration: for example, when a class declaration <code>AMyClass new = ()()</code> is loaded or saved in the IDE, one instance of the 'class factory object' named <code>AMyClass</code> is created.  The role of the special object <code>AMyClass</code> is to produce instances of <code>class AMyClass</code>
</p>

<p>
<b>The platform objects (objects that represent the Newspeak system), or the dependencies objects or classes (classes that need to be "imported" from the manifest) are passed to the primary factory method and held on slots.  From there, they are available to all nested classes and nested objects of the top level instance!</b>
</p>

<p>
The <i>primary factory method</i> names on the <i>top level classes</i> have eerily similar signatures.  I was asking myself why, what do they have in common.  So I listed examples of the primary factory method names.  Here is the list of the <i>primary factory methods</i> on some top level classes:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org90b976a">
class AccessModifierTesting                 usingPlatform:       platform  testFramework: minitest = (| etc
class AccessModifierTestingConfiguration    packageTestsUsing:   manifest = (| etc
class ActivationMirrorTesting               usingPlatform:       platform minitest: m = (| etc
class ActivationMirrorTestingConfiguration  packageTestsUsing:   manifest = (| etc
class ActorsForPrimordialSoup               usingPlatform:       platform = (| etc
class AliensForV8                           usingPlatform:       platform = ( etc
class Browsing                              usingPlatform:       platform ide: webIde = ( etc
class Collections                           usingPlatform:       platform = ( etc
class CollectionsForPrimordialSoup          usingInternalKernel: ik = ( etc
class CombinatorialParsing                  usingPlatform:       platform = ( etc
class RuntimeForV8                          packageUsing:        manifest = ( etc
class Streams                               usingPlatform:       platform = ( etc
</pre>

<p>
We can see that the primary factory methods accept, at first position, one of 2 arguments
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>platform</code></li>
<li><code>manifest</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
If the constructor first argument is <code>platform</code>, the constructor name <b>always starts with</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>#usingPlatform: platform</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
If the constructor first argument is <code>manifest</code>, the constructor name is <b>always one of</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>#packageUsing: manifest</code></li>
<li><code>#packageTestsUsing: manifest</code> (for tests only)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Clearly, <code>platform</code> and <code>manifest</code>, must be significant!
</p>

<p>
What are those objects? And what do they contain, why are they significant, and what role do they play in Newspeak? 
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-5-5-1">
<p>
So what is in the manifest, why it is significant, and what role does it play in Newspeak?
</p>

<p>
We can look at the code, and ask what Newspeak passes into the <code>manifest</code> parameter.  We find that there is only one place that calls <code>#packageUsing: manifest</code>, and it passes for <code>manifest</code> the value of object <code>ide namespacing manifest</code>.  So we can examine what <code>ide namespacing manifest</code> contains.  In Workspace, let us evaluate it:
</p>

<pre class="example">
ide namespacing manifest
</pre>


<div id="orgd57fb8f" class="figure">
<p><img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-ide-namespacing-manifest.png" alt="nil"/>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Drilling into the instance, we can see it is a map, and sorting by the key, we can see the map elements:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgec583e0">
at: AccessModifierTesting   AccessModifierTesting
at: AccessModifierTestingConfiguration   AccessModifierTestingConfiguration
  etc
</pre>

<p>
By looking at the IDE, we see that the <b>manifest is a map containing exactly all top-level classes in the IDE - that is, all module classes known to the IDE!</b>
</p>

<p>
So we have a experiment based answer to what the manifest object contains.
</p>

<p>
But what is the manifest good for?  We discuss that further down, but as a look ahead: the values of the manifest map are classes that can be "imported" and "kept" during packaging of the module!

<p>
We can look at the code, and ask what Newspeak passes into the <code>platform</code> parameter when calling, for example, <code>#usingPlatform: platform</code>.
</p>

<p>
This is little harder than with manifest, so let's cheat a bit.  In Workspace, let us evaluate <code>platform</code>
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-workspace-eval-platform.png" alt="nil"/>
Drilling into the link "instance of PlatformWithHopscotch`number", we see a list of instances. Sorting the list, we can see it contains <code>instances</code> of a few classes that look like system classes:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org32ea1aa">
instance of ActorsForPrimordialSoup
instance of CollectionsForPrimordialSoup
instance of FontsForHTML5
instance of GraphicsForHTML5
instance of HopscotchForHTML5

instance of Kernel
instance of MirrorsForPrimordialSoup
instance of PrimordialFuel
instance of TextModule
</pre>

<p>
Classes of all of those instances also exist in the <code>manifest</code> object. 
</p>

<p>
From the above, we have a good indication as to what does the platform object contain: <b>the platform object contains instances of system classes from the manifest!</b>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-5-7">
<p>
TL;DR: Recall that module is instance of a top level class in IDE.  <code>manifest</code> is needed during Applications and Libraries instance creation for packaging for distribution, to pull from it (include) all class declarations instance depends on; <code>platform</code> is needed any time a module  requires an instance of another module (top level class) - the only way for module to gain another module is through platform. More details are below, and in the section <a href="#org4ad2904">Modules: Application, Library, TestConfiguration, General</a>.  
</p>

<p>
Why are the <code>platform</code> and <code>manifest</code> objects so important to appear again and again in the <i>top level classes' factory parameters</i>, as seen in <a href="#orgd8753e7">Primary factory methods</a> ?
</p>

<p>
The answer is somewhat common for <code>manifest</code> and <code>platform</code>, so we describe their role in this common section.
</p>

<p>
The common need for both <code>manifest</code> and <code>platform</code> stems from modularity.  But what does that mean?
</p>

<p>
In <a href="#org8bac09d">Newspeak terminology,</a> we saw that the <i>modules</i> are DEFINED AS <i>instances of top level classes</i>.
</p>

<p>
And we saw that there is no global namespace in Newspeak.  Modules need other objects (dependencies) to do useful work.  In Newspeak, for a module to "contain" ANY dependency, such dependency must be on the module instance slot (slot is like a member variable).  Also, at the point of the module construction we MUST supply such dependency.  Because only the <i>primary factory</i> can define slots, the <b>module primary factory must be passed everything the module needs from outside</b>.  
</p>

<p>
This is where <code>platform</code> and <code>manifest</code> come in.  They are "special" in the sense that they supply objects and classes needed by the module.  But each is needed at a special point of the module lifecycle: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><span class="underline">The <i>manifest</i> object is needed at packaging step on the system where we create the package</span>: <i>manifest</i> is passed to the module packaging method such as <code>#package(Something)Using: manifest</code> which packages dependencies that need to be carried over from the system we are packaging on, to the module artifact that is copied to the deployment platform.</li>
<li><span class="underline">The <i>platform</i> object is needed on the deployment step on the deployment system</span>, to instantiate the module by <code>#(buildSomething)usingPlatform: platform</code> or perform the module work and passed there to the runtime method such as or <code>main: platform args: args</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>
We can reword the above as follows:
</p>

<p>
We already know that any Newspeak object can have only one "slot defining constructor" (called <i>primary factory</i>) in it's API.  But, as a module needs both <code>platform</code> and <code>manifest</code>, how can we ensure a module has both available?  This is done by <b>convention methods</b>, that are either a <i>primary factory</i> or a regular <i>instance method</i>, depending whether the module is an <i>App, Library, and Test configuration module</i> OR a <i>General</i> module.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>App, Library, and Test configuration modules (but not "General modules") have a <b>primary factory</b> passing a <code>manifest</code> in it's API. This <i>primary factory</i> is named similar to <code>#package(Something)Using: manifest</code>.  This factory is called on the system where we create the package to "import" objects and/or their classes during packaging (by placing them to the package artifact which can be delivered over to the runtime system).</li>
<li>Any "General" modules (not App, Library, or Test configurations) have a <b>factory</b> passing a <code>platform</code> in it's API. This <i>primary factory</i> is named similar to <code>#(buildSomething)usingPlatform: platform</code>.  This factory is called on the runtime system for module instantiation.  An App, Library, and Test configuration module (where the <i>primary factory</i> is already taken by presence of method passing platform such as <code>#package(Something)Using: manifest</code>) would typically also have this method in it's API, but NOT as a factory, rather as an instance method.</li>
</ul>

<p>

In a nutshell, 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We need <i>manifest</i> classes for packaging.  Manifest provides the classes needed to "bring along" (import) in the package.  Those "bring along" or "import" classes may not exist on the end-user system, so they need to be added to the package!</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-6">
<p>
TL;DR: This section is the core reason why I started writing the top section <a href="#orgfe6bdc2">6</a>.  It exploits the <i>role/s (aka /abilities</i>, aka <i>requirements</i>) any program in most languages on most Operating systems performs: a program must be able to <b>start execution</b>, then <b>instantiate, load or link libraries, then use them</b>. In addition, any program should be <b>packageable</b> for distribution.  Libraries are shareable artifacts.  In Newspeak, programs, libraries, even tests, are instances of top level classes (modules).  In Newspeak, each <i>role</i> a particular module performs, is enabled by providing the module with a "convention method" which performs the <i>role</i>.  This section is about the /role/s and the "convention method" signatures for Newspeak modules.
</p>

<p>
Terminology: We use the name <i>role/s for what is above described as /role/s (aka /abilities</i>, aka <i>requirements</i>).
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcf9c57c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgcf9c57c"><span class="section-number-4">6.6.1.</span> Application and library in computing</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-6-1">
<p>
In computing, any program in most languages on most Operating systems must be able to <b>start execution</b>, then <b>load or link libraries, then use them</b>; in addition,  any program should be <b>packageable</b> for distribution.  We term each such ability a <i>role</i>.  In computing, we tend to separate artifacts into (executable) Application and (linked) Libraries.  We can itemize such roles as follows.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>An Application must be able to <b>start execution</b> on the platform to which it is targeted (here, platform in the sense of "Linux platform", "Android platform", "Windows platform", and in our situation, the "Newspeak platform").</li>
<li>A Library must be able to be <b>load and link other libraries</b>, at least in principle, by the caller Application or another Library on that platform.  The library <i>used</i> by an Application or another Library is often called a dependency.  The term <i>used</i> implies that the Library is <b>found</b> and <b>connected</b> to the Application or Library which is using it. We can call this ability <b>buildDependencies</b></li>
<li>In addition, we should be able to <b>package</b> both the Application and the Library for distribution (deployment). Packaging includes <b>instantiation</b> and <b>serialization</b>.</li>
</ol>


<p>
So an Application needs to provide a facility (API, method) to perform /role/s 1 and 3.  A Library needs to provide a facility to perform /role/s 2 and 3.
</p>

<p>
From the generic /role/s above, both Application and Library need some way to perform the /role/s.  Methods perform /role/s, so we need some "convention methods" to perform the roles 1, 2, 3.  Such "convention methods" represent a public API, described in the following section.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgfefc079" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgfefc079"><span class="section-number-4">6.6.2.</span> Application and library API in computing</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-6-2">
<p>
Following the basic /role/s from the previous section <a href="#orgcf9c57c">6.6.1</a> in mainstream computing, we need  "convention methods" to perform the /role/s 1, 2, 3 in the previous section.  We choose to name such "convention methods" as follows:  (the names are arbitrary, but conventional, and represent the APIs understood on the platform)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For an App:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To perform <i>role</i> 3, <i>instantiateForPackaging</i>, let's call the method <code>#package</code>.</li>
<li>To perform <i>role</i> 1, <i>start execution</i>, let's call the method <code>#main</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>For a Library:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To perform <i>role</i> 3, <i>instantiateForPackaging</i>, let's call the method <code>#packageLibrary</code></li>
<li>To perform <i>role</i> 2, <i>buildDependencies</i>, let's call the method <code>#build</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
A mainstream system has the advantage of access to a global namespace - generally a filesystem via a PATH, CLASSPATH, PYTHONPATH or similar.  We discussed that earlier as well.  Inside any of these methods, during execution, the program can look and find various artifacts it needs on the platform.  If we start the method equivalent to "#main" in Python, inside #main there may be a line of code such as <code>from graphics import Rectangle</code>.  So we need the Rectangle class.  No problem, we go to the classpath, find the namespace <i>graphics</i>, there lives the module <i>graphics</i>, and the class <i>Rectangle</i> is there.  We load it and continue.

<div id="outline-container-org9ad5139" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org9ad5139"><span class="section-number-4">6.6.3.</span> Application and library modules in Newspeak</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-6-3">
<p>
In Newspeak, everything is done via objects.  So Application and Library must be an object.  Further, Newspeak starts all operations on the instances of top level classes, that is, on modules. For terminology, see <a href="#org8bac09d">Newspeak terminology</a>, also <a href="#org0bf4fc9">Discussion of Modules</a>.
</p>

<p>
But Newspeak cannot load anything globally.  If the API for the Application and library was as defined above in <a href="#orgfefc079">Application and library API in computing</a>, applications would not run as there would be no way to bring anything from a construct such as the CLASSPATH.  In more detail if the App's <code>#main</code> method defined above was to run, and Newspeak would discover the equivalent of "import" (which is slot creation in primary factory methods), it would not be able to find the "imported" dependency module.  It does not have the global namespace or access to the  PATH, CLASSPATH, PYTHONPATH or similar. 
</p>

<p>
<b>The solution is, during instantiation of Newspeak Application and Library objects, all the runtime dependencies (or rather their classes) are passed to the <i>primary factory methods</i> and stored on slots, to be "carried along" in the objects for serialization and distribution. The dependencies are passed to the factory methods in the manifest object, which has all the top level classes in it</b>. See <a href="#org385b87d">The manifest object</a>.
</p>

<p>
Once an Application and Library object exists, it is serialized on the source system, and sent to a different (target) system where it is deserialized. At that point, on the target system, it needs to be used to be useful. <b>Newspeak defines methods for such use. These methods accept an object which is TYPICALLY NOT part of the serialized instances: The <code>platform</code> object. It encapsulates the common capabilities of the Newspeak system on all systems (platforms, hence the name)</b>. See <a href="#orgc902e35">The platform object</a>.
</p>

<p>
Nespeak extends the signatures of /role/s 1, 2, 3 from previous chapter to provide the "carry over" (imported) classes from <code>manifest</code>, and system classes from <code>platform</code>, Newspeak uses the following signature names:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>For an App</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To perform <i>role</i> 3, <i>instantiateForPackaging</i>, Newspeak uses the primary factory method <code>#packageUsing: manifest</code>.</li>
<li>To perform <i>role</i> 1, <i>start execution</i>, Newspeak uses the instance method <code>#main: platform args: args</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>For a Library</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To perform <i>role</i> 3, <i>instantiateForPackaging</i>, Newspeak uses the primary factory method <code>#packageLibraryUsing: manifest</code></li>
<li>To perform <i>role</i> 2, <i>buildDependencies</i>, Newspeak uses the instance method <code>#buildUsing: platform</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
These four methods are core "convention methods" for all Newspeak modules which we want to behave as either Apps or Libraries.

<p>
<b>Here are the APIs which define whether a Newspeak module is an App, a Library, a TestConfiguration, or a General module</b>.

<li><b>Note:</b> Tests, by convention, need two classes to be created. If class MyTestModule has the test methods, MyTestModuleConfiguration must be created.  This is the class we are talking about in this section. There are no "convention methods" on the test module MyTestModule.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><b>Newspeak General module</b> is <i>any other module</i> - any module that does not have any of the above API.  General modules <b>do not have any convention API name</b>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>However, we often find they have a <i>primary factory method</i> named <b>similar to</b> <code>#usingPlatform: platform [and: otherObjects]</code> which create a working instance. Note that the [and: otherObjects] portion is completely free, it can be named differently.  
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>These modules can for example be 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>modules we distribute using the <i>Library Distribution module</i></li>
<li>tests we run using the <i>TestConfiguration module</i></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that on Application and Library modules, the methods which <b>perform the packaging</b>, are <i>primary factory methods</i> (<code>manifest</code> is passed to them), while the methods which perform <b>execution or build</b> are <i>instance methods</i> (<code>platform</code> is passed to them).  The reason is, a <i>primary factory method</i> is the only method which can store stuff in slots! So any classes needed to be "carried along" for packaging (pulled from manifest then "imported" on the target platform during construction), must be placed on slots during the primary factory method call.
</p>

<p>
Note that the IDE uses the presence of certain methods to show appropriate action links.  For example,
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If the method <code>#packageUsing: manifest</code> exists in the module, IDE shows links to <b>[deploy] [configurations] [run] [debug]</b></li>
<li>If the method <code>#packageTestsUsing: manifest</code> exists in the module, IDE shows links to <b>[run tests] [show tests]</b></li>
</ul>

TL;DR: This section shows a table of Newspeak "Module type"s in rows, and "convention method" signatures each "Module type" must provide.  Given a "convention method" signature, we know the <i>role</i> or /role/s the method performs.  The table is a summary of conclusions of the above section <a href="#org5ca8807">Newspeak modules API summary</a>.  For motivation of the need for "convention methods", see the top section <a href="#orgfe6bdc2">6</a>, in particular it's subsection <a href="#org4ad2904">Modules: Application, Library, TestConfiguration, General</a>,
</p>

<p>
In general computing there are artifacts, performing /role/s of <b>applications</b>, <b>libraries</b>, and <b>tests</b>.  In Newspeak, equivalents of such artifacts are uniform: they are all instances of a specific module.  We say that a module instance has a "Module type" in Newspeak, if the module instance has all required "convention method"s for all /role/(s) required by the "Module type".
</p>

<p>
Terminology: "Module type" is not a formal term in Newspeak.  We use the term "Module type" to group module instances according to their "convention methods" - in other words, according to their <i>role/s.  Also, in text, we use the brief /Application module</i> instead of <i>Application module type</i>, <i>General module</i> instead of <i>General module type</i> etc.
</p>

<p>
The table below summarizes, for each "Module type" in Newspeak, the "convention methods" names and the /role/(s) each such method performs.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The headings for "Module type" Library, App, and TestConfiguration are separated from the headings for "Module type" General, and Test as the /role/s differ:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The modules of type Library, App, TestConfiguration  require multiple <i>roles</i>, provided by two required "convention method"s for each type.</li>
<li>The modules of type General and Test only requires the /role/=instantiate, provided by only one required "convention method" for each type.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For any Application module: When we click the [run] button in the IDE, the IDE calls the Application's primary factory method <code>#packageUsing: manifest</code>, then the instance method <code>#main: platform args: args</code> which runs the app in the IDE.   Similarly, when we click on the [deploy] button in the IDE, the same methods are (eventually) called, followed by calling serialization methods, which serialize the instance to bytes and save them as <code>.vfuel</code> file.</li>
<li>A Library module and an Application module play a similar role.  However, an Application module is intended to be <b>packaged, distributed and executed</b> as a standalone App, while an Library module is intended to be <b>packaged, distributed and included in Application modules or other library modules</b>.</li>
<li>For any General module: The method signatures ARE NOT FIXED BY CONVENTION, they are only <b>softly conventional</b>. That helps humans to distinquish their invocations from nested classes. The signature <code>#usingPlatform: platform [andModule: m1]</code> is an example of a primary factory method which is passed the platform and a dependency which is module m1.</li>
<li><code>TestRunner.ns</code> is later packaged(instantiated), then called <code>main:args:</code> which runs Test instances returned from <code>#testModulesUsingPlatform: platform minitest: m</code></li>

We can provide a "recipy" for how any Application module should be written:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In the primary factory method <code>#packageUsing: manifest</code>, store any "carry along" (imported) classes from the manifest map on the slots</li>
<li>In the instance method <code>#main: platform args: args</code>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First use all (imported) classes on slots to instantiate them:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For each slot which is a General module class, call its primary factory methods, to build the module (dependency). The General module primary factory signature may be similar to <code>#usingPlatform: platform [andModule: m1]</code>, or <code>#usingModule: m1</code>, or just <code>#new</code>.</li>
<li>For each slot which is a Library module class, call its build instance methods, named similar to <code>#buildUsing: platform</code>, to build the 3rd party module (dependencies)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Next, on the instances created just before, call appropriate methods to run the Application.  If the application has a UI, it usually needs to instantiate its Model and Subject, then invoke code similar to <code>platform hopscotch HopscotchWindow openSubject: subjectInstance</code>.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-6-6-2">
<p>
Often, we start developing a module (more precisely, a module declaration, the source of a top level class) for "internal" use, with no need to "ship" it as an Application or a Library for others to use. Such module would be built as a General module with methods described above in <a href="#org8b9fb6e">Newspeak modules API zoo</a>. Later, we may decide to make this module available to others as a library or an app. This step of converting a General module available as a Library or an Application, <span class="underline">requires adding specific API methods</span>, which identify the General module we started with as an Application module or a Library module.  
Note that initially, our General module has a primary factory method named similar to <code>#usingPlatform: platform:</code>. From the API naming "convention" in <a href="#org8b9fb6e">Newspeak modules API zoo</a>, we can deduce a "recipy" to convert a General module to an Application or a Library, as follows:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>App: If we want to convert a General module to an Application, we need to
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>move the primary factory method from the General module to an instance method <code>#main: platform args: args</code>.</li>
<li>add a primary factory method <code>#packageUsing: manifest</code> and store any needed classes from manifest. The code of this new primary factory method should generally declare a slot for each class that will be needed at runtime, "import" (pull) the class from the manifest, and store it on the slot.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Library: If we want to convert a General module to a Library, we need to
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>move the primary factory method to an instance method named <code>#buildUsing: platform</code></li>
<li>add a primary factory method <code>#packageLibraryUsing: manifest</code>.</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-6-6-3">
<p>
An alternative to the previous section could be, that the General module class we created remains unchanged, and we add a "wrapper" Library module or a "wrapper" Application module. In this situation, our original General module code remains unchanged.
</p>

<p>
Becaus unlike the previous section, we are adding new top level modules, let's give the modules names. Let us assume the original General module is named <code>MyModule</code> and has a primary factory method, named <code>#usingPlatform: platform:</code>, and instance method <code>#doWork</code> which performs work for some role useful for client applications. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
If we want to wrap <code>MyModule</code> as an App, we could add the Application class wrapper similar to

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-7-0-3">
<p>
This next step describes an example of a module which is intended to be distributable as a library. In Newspeak, <b>this means such module must be both packageble and distributable</b> - the roles of "packageble" and "distributable" are achieved by implementing the 2 methods below. We call such modules informally <i>Library modules</i>.
</p>

<p>
In the previous section, we introduced a general module <code>RecipyWithDep</code>. If we needed this module to be used as a library we could
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>either "convert" <code>RecipyWithDep</code> into a library,</li>
<li>or add a "wrapper library" which will be the module used for distrubution.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In this example, we show the second method - we add a "wrapper library" for <code>RecipyWithDep</code> in two steps
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>We add a <b>separate module - the wrapper library</b> with a descriptive name (to make clear it is a library), <code>RecipyWithDepLib</code></li>
<li>In the new <code>RecipyWithDepLib</code>, add the following API methods:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>primary factory method <code>#packageLibraryUsing: manifest</code>, which allows to "import" the <code>RecipyWithDep</code> and the other needed dependency <code>RecipyNoDep</code></li>
<li>Instance method        <code>#buildUsing: platform</code>, which allows dependencies to be pulled at construction time</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that in this case, <i>#buildUsing: platform</i> must not be added any other arguments. Any "carry along" (imported) classes that may be needed at build time, must be saved on slots in the <i>#packageLibraryUsing: manifest</i> primary factory method.  See also <a href="#org8b9fb6e">Newspeak modules API zoo</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8230dec" class="outline-6">

To create a packageble and distributable library module for the above <code>RecipyWithDep</code>, create this library module

  RecipyWithDep = manifest RecipyWithDep.
  RecipyNoDep   = manifest RecipyNoDep.

                    andModule: (RecipyNoDep new).
     ^revertedTranslator.
  )
)
</pre>

<p>
Note how the library must store any "carry along" (imported) classes on slots during packaging, then instantiate them during building. 
</p>

<p>
Also note how the passing of <code>platform</code> moves from the primary factory in the module, to the instance method in the library:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In the module <code>RecipyWithDep</code> , it is on the <i>primary factory method</i> <i>#usingPlatform: platform:</i></li>
<li>To the distribution library <code>RecipyWithDepLib</code>, it is on the <i>instance method</i> <i>#buildUsing: platform</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Although intended for distribution, for testing this process, the library can be used in workspace as 
</p>

<p>
If we need our module <code>RecipyWithDep</code> to be packagable as an App:

</ol>

<p>
<b>Note 1:</b>
</p>

<p>
We sometimes see Newspeak Application modules lacking the <code>#main: platform args: args</code> method. Such modules are used as library modules.

The instance methods serve to build (for Library) or execute (for App).
</p>

<p>
If an Application uses a Library, the library's (build) <code>#buildUsing: platform</code> would be called in the App's <code>#main: platform args: args</code> method to build (create) the library's instance.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-6-7-0-4-1">
<p>
We will create an Application module <code>RecipyWithDepApp</code>, which is a bit more complex App, in the sense it uses a pre-existing library module, <code>RecipyWithDep</code>, defined in <a href="#orgb873180">3. Library module: API of module that needs to be distributed for use in other modules</a>.
</p>

<p>
To create a packageble and runnable Application module <code>RecipyWithDepApp</code>, it must have a primary factory method <code>#packageUsing: manifest</code> and an instance method <code>#main: platform args: args</code>.  The Application must also store at it's slots everything the <code>RecipyWithDep</code> needs for it's instantiation. Here is how the code may look:
</p>

<pre class="example">
class RecipyWithDepApp packageUsing: manifest = (
  |
  RecipyWithDep = manifest RecipyWithDep.
  RecipyNoDep   = manifest RecipyNoDep.
  |
) 
(
  public main: platform args: args = (
     |revertedTranslator|
     revertedTranslator::  RecipyWithDep 
                    usingPlatform: platform 
                    andModule: (RecipyNoDep new).

    (revertedTranslator translate: {' World'. 'Hello'}) out.
  )
)
</pre>

<p>
Note how the Application stores any "carry along" (imported) classes from the manifest on slots during packaging in the <code>packageUsing: manifest</code> factory, then instantiate the "carry along" classes in <code>#main: platform args: args</code> at runtime. For a library, this happ build time). 
</p>

<p>
Also note when we converted the General module to an App:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In the General module <code>RecipyWithDep</code>, the <code>platform</code> object is passed to the <i>primary factory method</i> <code>#usingPlatform: platform:</code>.</li>
<li>In the Application module     <code>RecipyWithDepApp</code>, the <code>platform</code> object is passed to the <i>instance method</i> <code>#main: platform args: args</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
See the section <a href="#orgc533d6d">A recipy to convert a General module to an Application or Library module</a> for a general recipy to convert a General module such as  <code>RecipyWithDep</code> to an Application such as <code>RecipyWithDepApp</code>.
</p>

<p>
Also note, as you add the Application class <code>RecipyWithDepApp</code> in the IDE, (using the "+ " button ), the IDE shows  <b>[deploy] [configurations] [run] [debug]</b> links beside it, recognizing the top level class as an App.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-8-3">
<p>
TL;DR: In this section, we will build a Hello World which is a <i>module</i> (an <i>instance of top level class</i> as we know already).  The code for this module is already in <a href="https://github.com/mzimmerm/newspeak-doc/tree/main/newspeak---a-few-notes-code/hello-world/2-as-general-module">https://github.com/mzimmerm/newspeak-doc/tree/main/newspeak---a-few-notes-code/hello-world/2-as-general-module</a>.  To skip the coding details above, we can download the <code>.ns</code> file(s), then <a href="#org519fcbe">"Compile file(s)"</a> to load the fully finished code from there; the loaded class will appear in the IDE.
</p>


<p>
The <a href="#org5ca8807">Newspeak modules API summary</a> section would classify this module as "General" module, because it does not have any of the special "convention methods" in it's API.  The only method of this class is it's default <i>primary factory method</i> <code>#new</code>.  
</p>

<p>
Continuing with the painfully detailed steps to create the Hello World general module in the Newspeak IDE:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In "Newspeak Source", on the top left, click the "+ " button next to the link "Root"</li>
<li>In the popup, select "Add Class"</li>
<li><p>
Replace the text under "Defining a new class" with
</p>
<pre class="example">
class HelloWorldGeneralModule = (
(*
 If we Accept this class declaration,
 or if we click on the class link,
 the "Hello World" string shows on the bottom.
  - How did it get there?
    - After click on the class link, the IDE prepares some things to present the class.  In the IDE, the class is presented inside an instance of the class.  So, the IDE creates an instance of the ~HelloWorldGeneralModule~, by invoking the implicit ~HelloWorldGeneralModule&gt;&gt;#new~ primary factory method.  The method body is executed, calling ~'Hello World ' out~.  ~#out~ is a method on String; it is implemented in the Wasm version to append a ~&lt;div&gt;'Hello World '&lt;/div&gt; element to the IDE's HTML document body, thus displaying the string at the end of the IDE's page.
    - Similarly, every time just click on the &gt; expand action to the left of the class name, a new instance is created by the IDE, causing one more 'Hello World' to appear.
*)

'Hello World ' out
) (

</pre></li>

<li>Click the "Accept" <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-accept-image.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Now the class link "HelloWorldGeneralModule" will appear in the list of classes</li>
<li>Click on the class link, and the class presented appears

<p>
This concludes the section on General Module class.  Before the next step, please reload the page, and select the third option to start fresh.  Alternatively, remove the class <code>HelloWorldGeneralModule</code>.  It's presence would repeatedly output "Hello World" at the end of the page body.  Class deletion can be done by clicking on the three dot popup menu  beside the classname, and selecting "Remove HelloWorldGeneralModule"

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-8-4">
<p>
TL;DR: In this section, we will build another Hello World version which is a full blown but rudimentary Newspeak Application.  The code for this module is already in <a href="https://github.com/mzimmerm/newspeak-doc/blob/main/newspeak---a-few-notes-code/hello-world/3-as-app/HelloWorldApp.ns">https://github.com/mzimmerm/newspeak-doc/blob/main/newspeak---a-few-notes-code/hello-world/3-as-app/HelloWorldApp.ns</a>.  To skip the coding details above, we can download the <code>.ns</code> file(s), then <a href="#org519fcbe">"Compile file(s)"</a> to load the fully finished code from there; the loaded class will appear in the IDE.
</p>

<p>
We now create a class that behaves as a Newspeak Application (as opposed as a general module in the previous section).  We need to give the module class two specific "convention methods" described in the sections <a href="#org5ca8807">Newspeak modules API summary</a> and <a href="#org8b9fb6e">Newspeak modules API zoo</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here are the steps to create the <code>HelloWorldApp</code> <b>Application</b> in the Newspeak IDE's
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
As shown in the previous section, click the "+ ", paste the following class to the IDE, and click the "Accept" button.
</p>
<pre class="example">
class HelloWorldApp packageUsing: manifest = () (
  public main: platform args: args = (
    (* 
    - In the IDE, we should see this class in the top classes list.  However, (as opposed to previous example ~HelloWorldGeneralModule~), this class has the links *[deploy] [configurations] [run] [debug]* beside it.  This shows as a result of the presence of the convention ~#packageUsing: manifest~ factory method.  The tools (the IDE) understand this message and use it to show actions that can be done with an App: run, debug, deploy, show available configurations.  In addition, the presence of the ~#main: platform args: args~ instance method makes the module runnable as a standalone Application.
    - Click the *[run]* link to run the app inside the IDE.  The IDE calls first the ~#packageUsing: manifest~, then the ~#main: platform args: args~ which runs, and the text 'Hello World from HelloWorldApp' will be appended at the end of the page, as described in  ~HelloWorldGeneralModule~.
    *)

    'Hello World from HelloWorldApp' out.
  )
) 
</pre></li>
<li>In the IDE, we should see this class in the top classes list.  However, (as opposed to previous section <code>HelloWorldGeneralModule</code>), this class has the links <b>[deploy] [configurations] [run] [debug]</b> beside it.  The links shows as a result of the presence of the convention factory method <code>#packageUsing: manifest</code>.  The tools (the IDE) understand this message and use it to show actions that can be done with an App: run, debug, deploy, show available configurations.  In addition, the presence of the <code>#main: platform args: args</code> instance method makes the module runnable as a standalone Application.</li>
<li>Click the <b>[run]</b> link to run the app inside the IDE.  The IDE calls first the <code>#packageUsing: manifest</code>, then the <code>#main: platform args: args</code> which runs, and the text <b>'Hello World from HelloWorldApp'</b> will be appended at the end of the page. This is similar but not the same as in the General module version <a href="#org92e2752">2. Hello World from general module</a>.  Here, unlike the General module version, the text is NOT appended when clicking on the class link.  That is because, in this Application version, the text <code>out</code> message is in the <code>#main: platform args: args</code> method, which runs after clicking the [run] button.  In the General module version, it is in the primary factory, which the IDE runs as it constructs an instance of the class on click. 
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-hello-world-app-output.png" alt="nil"/></li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>Next, we will show how to deploy our <code>HelloWorldApp</code> as a standalone Application.</b>
</p>

<p>
From the section <a href="#org52d3205">5.4</a> we know an Application can be packaged and deployed standalone into a local Newspeak webserver.
</p>

<p>
Follow steps below to create a deployable app <code>HelloWorldApp.vfuel</code>, then deploy it in a local Newspeak installation.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Action: In the class list, find the <code>HelloWorldApp</code> again, and click the [deploy] to the right.</li>
<li>Result: a popup showing deployment options, starting with <code>asVictoryFuel</code>: <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-click-deploy-on-counter-app.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Action: Select <code>asVictoryFuel</code>.  We choose the faster option 'asVictoryFuel' because our Application does not have GUI.  Otherwise, we would select 'asVictoryFuelWithMirrors'</li>
<li>Result: After a long wait, a file named <code>HelloWorldApp.vfuel</code> is created, and asked to be saved.</li>
<li>Action: Save the file <code>HelloWorldApp.vfuel</code> on our disk to the directory where local Newspeak was deployed - for example <code>$HOME/software/newspeak/my-serve-http/servable</code></li>
<li>Result: <b>Assuming you installed you local Newspeak webserver as in e <a href="#orga40f49a">5.3</a>, the app is now deployed to the local Newspeak webserver!</b></li>

<li>Result: We see the output of the standalone-running app
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-hello-world-app-standalone-output.png" alt="nil"/></li>
</ul>

<p>
This concludes the section on Application Module class.  We have shown how to create an App, run it in IDE, create a deployable .vfuel file, then deploy the Application standalone in local Newspeak webserver.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-8-5">
<p>
TL;DR:  This section builds, step by step, a Hello World Application named <code>HelloWorldAppUsingLib</code>. The goal of this section is to show how to <b>use a 3rd party Library named <code>HelloTranslatorLib</code> in an application</b>.  All code is in <a href="https://github.com/mzimmerm/newspeak-doc/tree/main/newspeak---a-few-notes-code/hello-world/4-as-app-using-translator-lib-as-3rd-party-dependency">https://github.com/mzimmerm/newspeak-doc/tree/main/newspeak---a-few-notes-code/hello-world/4-as-app-using-translator-lib-as-3rd-party-dependency</a>.  To skip the coding detailed steps, we can download, then <a href="#org519fcbe">"Compile file(s)"</a> to load the fully finished code; the loaded classes will appear in the IDE. Then you can browse, [run], or [deploy] the Application. Running the Application produces the text translated to German: <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-hello-world-with-dependency-german.png" alt="nil"/>
</p>

<p>
But continuing with the step by step process:
</p>

<p>
Let's pretend our Application wants to use a Newspeak module produced by a 3rd party (3rd party to us). Call the 3rd party the <i>TranslatorCorp</i>. Let's pretend <i>TranslatorCorp</i> provides the module <code>HelloTranslator</code>, packaged as <code>HelloTranslatorLib</code>.
</p>

<p>
<i>TranslatorCorp</i> would implement and package their modules as follows:
</p>

<pre class="example">
class HelloTranslator = ()
(
    public translate: text = (
      text = 'Hello World from HelloWorldApp' ifTrue: [^ 'Hallo Welt von HelloWorldApp'.].

      ^ 'unable to translate'.
    )  
)
</pre>

<pre class="example">
class HelloTranslatorLib packageLibraryUsing: manifest = (

    (* Library (distribution) class provides packaging and building of the HelloTranslator module *) 
    | 
    HelloTranslator = manifest HelloTranslator. 
    |
)
(
   public buildUsing: platform = (
     |helloTranslator|
     helloTranslator:: HelloTranslator new.

     ^helloTranslator.
   )
)
</pre>

<p>
Note that for every module the <i>TranslatorCorp</i> wants to distribute (such as <code>HelloTranslator</code>), they need to create a library module for packaging and disctribution(such as <code>HelloTranslatorLib</code>)
</p>

<p>
The <code>HelloTranslator</code>, hence the <code>HelloTranslatorLib</code> 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>could have used (depended on) other module <code>HelloTRanslatorHelper</code>  developed by the <i>TranslatorCorp</i></li>
<li>and also depend on a module <code>LanguageSelectorLib</code> developed by another entity <i>LanguageCorp</i> (so <i>LanguageCorp</i> is "3rd party to <i>TranslatorCorp</i>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Then, the <i>TranslatorCorp</i> would work in their helper module and the <i>LanguageCorp's</i> module as follows:
</p>

<pre class="example">
class HelloTranslatorLibWithMoreDependencies packageLibraryUsing: manifest = (

  (* This version of HelloTranslatorLib is not ready yet due to missing
     HelloTranslatorHelper and LanguageSelectorLib.
     Use the above version in your IDE experiments
  *)
  | 
  HelloTranslator = manifest HelloTranslator.
  HelloTranslatorHelper = manifest HelloTranslatorHelper.
  LanguageSelectorLib = manifest LanguageSelectorLib packageLibraryUsing: manifest.
  |
)
(
  public buildUsing: platform = (
    |defaultlanguageSelector helloTranslator|

    defaultlanguageSelector = LanguageSelectorLib buildUsing: platform.

    helloTranslator = HelloTranslator
                        helpedBy: (HelloTranslatorHelper new)
                        with3rdPartyLanguageSelector: defaultlanguageSelector.
    (* or #usingPlatform:helpedBy:with3rdPartyLanguageSelector: if platform was needed *)

    ^helloTranslator.
  )
)
</pre>


<p>
Either way, we would develop our Application by packaging the 3rd party dependency and storing it on slot as <code>helloTranslatorLib</code>, then at runtime, build instance of the <code>helloTranslator</code> using the packaged <code>helloTranslatorLib</code>, and last, calling the method on <code>helloTranslator</code> which performs the translation:
</p>

<p>
This is how the Application <code>HelloWorldAppUsingLib</code> would look. 
</p>

<pre class="example">
class HelloWorldAppUsingLib packageUsing: manifest = (
  |
  helloTranslatorLib = manifest HelloTranslatorLib packageLibraryUsing: manifest.
  |
)
(
  public main: platform args: args = (
    |helloTranslator|
    helloTranslator:: helloTranslatorLib buildUsing: platform.

    (helloTranslator translate: 'Hello World from HelloWorldApp') out.
  )
)
</pre>

<p>
As shown in the previous section <a href="#org9a7e285">3. Hello World from Application</a>, we can click [run] to run the Application from the IDE, or package it a ".vfuel" file, and distribute to run as a standalone Application from a local Newspeak webserver (or as an Electon based on Android, iOS, or desktop, but this is not shown yet).

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-1-2">
<p>
This method downloads a pre-packaged Newspeak, and allows you to start your local Newspeak webserver, which starts the pre-packaged Newspeak.  This method is described in detail in the "hands on" section <a href="#orga40f49a">5.3</a>.  Follow the steps there.

<h4 id="org8d80114"><span class="section-number-4">7.1.3.</span> <a id="org09a1ac3"></a> Installation method 3: Download or setup a local Electron version of Newspeak on MacOS or Windows</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-7-1-3">
<p>
To install using this method, download the available versions for Windows and Mac, see <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/downloads.html">https://newspeaklanguage.org/downloads.html</a>, section "Downloadable IDE App". 
</p>

<p>
Electron is basically Chromium underneath.  It's just set up to read from a page that's built in to the app.  So no server needs to be started.  It starts with starting the app.
</p>

<p>
An advantage of Electron that I have seen is a better integration with OS File access dialogues.  It doesn't insist on using a downloads directory for everything (and while browsers let you set the directory, they don't let you change it on the fly, on a file-by-file basis).

<p>
If the build isn't working for you there is one option that hasn't been discussed, which is relevant to Linux folk who don't have an Electron app.  You can get the web IDE vfuel file at:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a> 
</p>

<p>
BUT &#x2026;  this isn't enough because you need a bunch more stuff, such as primordialsoup.html, primordialsoup.js, primordialsoup.wasm.
If you run that, you'll find that you also need a longish list of .png files for the various images used by the IDE.  Here they are (probably a few that are no longer used too).

You can place it all in the directory of your choice and serve from there (the serve.sh script wants it in the repo, in the out directory).
It seems easier to build, but I'm putting it out there.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
TL;DR: This section provides a script which builds both the Wasm VM and deployable <code>.vfuel</code>  files from source <code>.ns</code> files (builds <code>.vfuel</code> files for any Newspeak application as well as the NewspeakIDE, called <code>HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</code>).  All <code>.vfuel</code> files are created in Step 7 of the script. Step 7.  Step 7 is typically run any time we make a code change in a Newspeak <code>.ns</code> file and want to redeploy it.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-1">
<p>
The script in this section installs software packages, which enable building <code>.vfuel</code> deployable files from source <code>.ns</code> files (for the Newspeak IDE, as well as tools, and any Newspeak app).
</p>

<p>
<b>Warning: This script should NOT be run directly, it should be used as a step-by-step process followed manually.  Running portions of this script, or in full, as any user WILL OVERRIDE files in the <code>$HOME/software/emsdk</code> and <code>$HOME/software/newspeak-wasm-build</code> directories. In addition, if the user is "root" on OpenSUSE, it will, install some <code>gcc</code> <code>gpp</code> or <code>c++</code> libraries.</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Steps 1. to 6. are one-time (provided they succeed). They provide prerequisits, then build the "primordialsoup" - the executable VM for Newspeak. Primordialsoup is used in step 7 to compile the Newspeak source <code>.ns</code> files into the browser-loaded <code>.vfuel</code> extension files.</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Step 7. is intended for repeat. It runs the <code>newspeak/build.sh</code>, which creates deployable <code>.vfuel</code> files. It should be run any time we make a code change in any Newspeak <code>.ns</code> file and want to redeploy it as <code>.vfuel</code>.  For example, if we creats a Newspeak app we want to deploy, run only this step.</b>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-9-1-2">
<p>
Could there be situations we do not want to simply reinstall the local Newspeak webserver? Perhaps one example of such situation is that we run our local Newspeak webserver with changed files, and we want to patch a class that has a known fix, without reinstalling the local Newspeak webserver and losing changes.
</p>

<p>
To describe a concrete (somewhat artificial) situation: Let's say that on Github, there is a bug fix or change in a 'system' class, <code>Browsing.ns</code>, and we want to update this single class locally.  We can identify changed files or files with fixes, and compile them in (that is, start using them in) the local version, using the following process:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Look for files committed on Github.</li>
<li>Find files changed since your last local install - let's say file <code>Browsing.ns</code> changed today to fix a bug.  As your local server uses the servable.zip file, <code>Browser.ns</code> is already compiled in your local vfuel.</li>
<li>So from the browser IDE, <a href="http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">http://localhost:8080/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a> from the 3-dot I "compile" the new version of Browsing.ns</li>
<li>Save the changes from IDE (clicking the save diskette image)</li>
<li>You can confirm that your changes were "Compile"d, by exporting of Browsing.ns (click the "Save to file" button to export the code).</li>
<li>The result of the above process is your local server are now using the github-fixed <code>Browsing.ns</code>.</li>

<h3 id="org5e01071"><span class="section-number-3">9.2.</span> Saving changes in Newspeak</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-2">
<p>
TL;DR: Changes can be saved either <i>inside the browser</i> in the browser's local storage, or, <i>outside the browser</i> on the filesystem.  Any changes you make (for example: you add a class, change a class, evaluate something in the workspace) are stored in the browser local storage in two entries: <b>lastSaved</b> and <b>backup</b>.  Clicking the "Accept" button  <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-accept-image.png" alt="nil"/> saves the changes in the local storage under the key <i>backup</i>, while clicking the "Save" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-save-button.png" alt="nil"/>, at any time after "Accept", saves the changes under the key <i>lastSaved</i>.  Alternatively, you can `export` code by clicking the "three dot menu" button to the right of the class, then clicking the "Save to file" item in the popup menu.  You can `import` code back to the browser IDE by clicking the "three dot menu" on the top, to the right of "Root +", then selecting the "Compile File(s)" in the popup menu.

<h4 id="org90a3119"><span class="section-number-4">9.2.1.</span> Saving changes inside the browser</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-9-2-1">
<p>
How is the browser local storage handled, and how is <i>lastSaved</i> different from <i>backup</i>? Here is a detail description of how changes are saved and restored:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>After making any code change or addition, to keep your changes, you have to click the "Accept" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-accept-image.png" alt="nil"/>.  Clicking "Accept" saves the changes in local storage under the key <i>backup</i>.</li>
<li>while</li>
<li>Clicking the "Save" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-save-button.png" alt="nil"/>, at any time after "Accept", saves the changes under the key <i>lastSaved</i> (the changes under <i>backup</i> are added and merged in to the changes under <i>lastSaved</i>).  Once saved using the "Save" button, changes are stored "forever", unless you reset browser local storage for the site.  We need to clarify, that making a change, followed by just clicking "Save" without a previous "Accept", nothing is saved.  So "Accept" and "Save" are sort of like two phase commit.</li>
<li>You can view the changes made, in the browser debugger.  For example, in Chrome or Chromium:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Press F12 to open Chrome debuger.</li>
<li>Then click the "Application" tab.</li>
<li>In the "Storage" section expand "Local Storage".</li>
<li>You can see our changes in the appropriate URL, both under the key <i>lastSaved</i> and the key <i>backup</i>.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>How does the/lastSaved/ and <i>backup</i> system work on browser restart? On restart, the Newspeak system checks to see if there are any changes under the key <i>backup</i> and/or under the key <i>lastSaved</i>.  If <i>lastSaved</i> changes exists, Newspeak checks if there are any subsequent changes under <i>backup</i>.  If not, we use the <i>lastSaved</i> version.  If there are unsaved changes (<i>backup</i> entry is not empty), a dialog will come up asking you how to proceed:  <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-message-restore-from-backup.png" alt="nil"/>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This message tells us, we did make code changes, then clicked "Accept" <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-accept-image.png" alt="nil"/>, without pressing "Save" <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-save-button.png" alt="nil"/>, and reloaded the page.  In other words, changes are stored under the key <i>backup</i> but not(yet) under <i>lastSaved</i>.  In most situations, pressing <b>Restore from backup</b> is the best choice.  Your code will load the changes from the <i>backup</i> key, and contain all your changes.  At any time, you can click "Save" and merge the <i>backup</i> changes to <i>lastSaved</i>.  After, the question above will not be asked until you made new changes and "Accepted" them.</li>
<li>For search purposes, here is the text of the message: "You have backup changes that are newer than your last save.  Do you want to restore these changes, or load from the last save?"</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Note: There is a fine point we should make.  Crudely, we can say that "the Newspeak IDE is the file <code>HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</code> interpreted by the browser when pointing to the URL <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel">https://newspeaklanguage.org/samples/primordialsoup.html?snapshot=HopscotchWebIDE.vfuel</a>.  However, we need to realize that the browser immediately downloads and caches this file.  Changing anything in Newspeak (adding a class, typing to the Workspace), causes the changes to be saved locally.  If we close the browser, and visit the same online URL again, we will see the site as we left it - with the local changes "added" to the vanilla Newspeak IDE! Which local changes are "added" (<i>backup</i> or <i>lastSaved</i> or both), is determined by your answer to the dialog above.</li>

<li>Caveats: There are a few caveats - a few classes are exempt from this "backup" and "lastSaved" method, due to bootstrap issues (things like KernelForPrimordialSoup and HopscotchWebIDE).  If you tamper with these - save the class explicitly! Also, web storage can surprise you on mobile platforms, where things can be thrown out after a certain amount of time (7 days on iOS?) and the system as a whole may exhibit bugs.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-9-2-2">
<p>
During development, any code additions and changes we make, are saved in-browser in the browser local storage, as described in <a href="#org90a3119">9.2.1</a>. But if we do clear the browser local storage, our changes will be lost.  While the browser local storage can be backed up as part of browser configuration, restoring it is cumbersome.
</p>

<p>
Consequently, saving our work (<i>source code</i>) outside the browser as text files is valuable.
</p>

<p>
<b>Current approach to saving our work during development (as text files)</b>
</p>

<p>
Until source control is integrated into the IDE, the current approach is to `export` ("Save to file") each class we changed into a directory on your system as a file with <code>.ns</code> extension.  We can also create a code repository in the directory with the <code>.ns</code> files.  
</p>

<p>

<p>
Note: To 'import' the saved text <code>*.ns</code> files back to the Newspeak IDE, click on the "Compile File(s)", as also described above.

We often ask "how is this class used"? "What is the result of calling one of it's methods"?  Answer can be provided by any of the following mechanisms:

<li>Reading the class code and deriving a result (in our head).</li>
<li>Finding a test for the class and the method and analyzing it's code and results.</li>
<li>Writing a simple example program using the class and method.  In Smalltalk and Newspeak, this is done by navigating to "Workspaces" and writing some code - instantiating the class, passing it's factory some arguments, and calling the method you are interested in.</li>

<h4 id="orge8a1edd"><span class="section-number-4">9.3.3.</span> A class with an exemplar</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-9-3-3">
<p>
A class with exemplar can be found at <a href="https://github.com/newspeaklanguage/newspeak/blob/master/BankAccount.ns">BankAccount</a> in Newspeak sources.
</p>

<p>
There are three exemplars in the code
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org7f519a2">
(* :exemplar: BankAccount balance: 100 *)
(* :exemplar: deposit: 100 *)
(* :exemplar: withdraw: 100 *) 
</pre>

<p>
From the source and the pulled comments, we can see that an exemplar is a piece of metadata inside comments. The metadata is expected to be valid Newspeak code after the text marked as <code>:exemplar:</code>.
</p>

<p>
We can also guess that the <code>:exemplar:</code> code provides a way to instantiate the class and run some methods on it - basically mimicking what we would do in a workspace if we wanted to explore the class instance's behavior.
</p>

<p>
From the source we can also see the <code>:exemplar:</code> comment is placed before the <code>=</code> sign in a factory or method declaration - that is the only place where the parser is looking for exemplars. 
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgf0414d8">
class BankAccount balance: b &lt;Integer&gt;
(* :exemplar: BankAccount balance: 100 *) = ( .. factory code .. )
</pre>

<p>
To make the :exemplar: stand out more, we can format the code so that the comment with exemplar occupies it's own line. The formatting above is "normative" though.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org9305372">
class BankAccount balance: b &lt;Integer&gt;
(* :exemplar: BankAccount balance: 100 *)
  = ( .. factory code .. )
</pre>

<h4 id="orgfe6e4c7"><span class="section-number-4">9.3.4.</span> Exemplars role</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-9-3-4">
<p>
The role of exemplars is two-fold:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Provide lively code in the IDE. By adding appropriate exemplars for a class, the IDE, when browsing the class, will use the exemplars code to create the class instance. Once an instance exists, it can call methods on it.</li>
<li>Provide code examples of class instantiation and running it's methods.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-9-3-5">
<p>
If a class such as the <code>BankAccount</code> provides exemplars (at least an exemplar for the primary factory method), <b>an instance of the BankAccount is presented in the IDE UI; the BankAccount class presenter is also shown, embedded in the instance</b>. 
</p>

<p>
Inclusion of an exemplar allows the IDE to create a live instance, present it's browser, and allows the user to interact with the live instance.
</p>

<p>
If a class such as the <code>BankAccount</code> does not provide exemplars, <b>only the BankAccount class presenter is shown in the IDE UI</b>. See the section below.
</p>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org7937b07" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org7937b07"><span class="section-number-5">9.3.5.1.</span> BankAccount class with an exemplar in the IDE</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-9-3-5-1">
<p>
Viewed inside the IDE, a class that provides an exemplar:
</p>


<div id="orga85b8e9" class="figure">
<p><img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-class-with-exemplar.png" alt="nil"/>
</p>
</div>

<p>
The line on top, starting with <b>self   instance of BankAccount</b> is the beginning of the object presenter. The presented object is the object the IDE created using the code in the <code>:exeplar:</code>  (s).
</p>

<p>
The line with the blue link to <b>BankAccount</b> (after the line with <b>class</b>) is the beginning of the class presenter section, embedded in the object presenter. The class presenter section ends just above the line <b>Evaluate Selection</b>. 
</p>

<p>
We can see that the <b>IDE UI presents the instance of the BankAccount, with the BankAccount class presenter embedded</b>. That places the emphasis on liveliness: The IDE user can experiment with the instance behavior inside the "Evaluate Selection" mini-workspace. An example of such experiment:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>In the workspace, type <code>deposit: 20</code> - a method name, and pass it a value.</li>
<li>Use the key Ctrl-A to highlight the code (This is browser specific, the Mac key for highlight would be different)
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-class-with-exemplar-invoke-method.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Use the key Shift-Enter to execute the message send. The IDE sends the message <code>deposit: 20</code> to the instance created by the IDE using the  code in the <code>:exemplar:</code>, which immediately updates the value of <code>balance_slot</code> from 100 to 120.
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-class-with-exemplar-invoke-method-shift-enter.png" alt="nil"/></li>
</ol>


<p>
As we can see, exemplars help to focus to browse instances and experiment with them by sending messages.
</p>

<p>
We can still browse the classes - in our case the BankAccount class, by clicking on it's link.
</p>

<p>
We can see only the class viewer is presented in the IDE (NOT the embedding object browser).
</p>

Correct. If there isn't an exemplar for self, the method exemplars cannot work.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-9-3-6-2">
<p>
There can in fact be multiple exemplar comments. An exemplar comment is one whose identifer (the name given between colons in the tag at the beginning of the comment) starts with #exemplar.
</p>

<p>
For example, we can define a method #foo:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orga229684">
public foo: x (* :exemplar_1:  foo: 3 *) (* an random comment *)  (:exemplar_2: foo: 'a' *) = (^x)

<h5 id="org8668373"><span class="section-number-5">9.3.6.3.</span> Are the exemplars always extracted from the comment before the " = (..)" section defining the primary factory method, instance method or class method, OR can they be at any position in the code?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-9-3-6-3">
<p>
Exemplars must be placed before the method body starts (or for classes, before factory body starts).
</p>

<p>
For a concrete example, let us look at this pseudo-code of primary factory method <code>balance: b</code>, see markings with &lt;== on the right
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgee9389d">
class BankAccount balance: b &lt;Integer&gt;
(* :exemplar: BankAccount balance: 100 *) = ( (* &lt;== This, and only this location is parsed for exemplar *)
	|
    balance_slot &lt;Integer&gt; ::= b.
	|
  (* :exemplar: BankAccount balance: 200 *) = ( (* &lt;== This would NOT be parsed for exemplar *)
) (
)
</pre>

<p>
Exemplar comments are just an instance of the general notion of metadata comments. You can have metadata comments everywhere, but there are general rules for what AST node a metadata comment applies to. Metadata must apply to the correct AST nodes. The mirror system looks for metadata  for methods and classes in these places. You can look at the methods #metadata and #parseMetadata in MethodMirror and ClassHeaderMirror, to see how this works; also the class MetadataParsing.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-9-3-6-4">
<p>
How do examplars look in general (for factories or methods), if a parameter is a "complex" object? ( rather than an object for which we can create a literal (Number, String, Boolean, List of the above etc) directly in the :examplar: text like in the BankAccount)
</p>

<p>
I know the second question is open,  but I am now curious how such exemplars are done. I can imagine if a parameter can be constructed from literals, then we just provide those parameter constructions as part of the exemplar. But if it goes deeper?
</p>

<p>
You may indeed need to build up the object from multiple parts, much as you might do in the #main:args: method of an application. You would want to define local variables for intermediate results etc.  So you write all this code in a block and call value on it:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgf056f3e">
class Complicated usingPlatform: p with: s  (* :exemplar: [ | T1 = SomeClass usingPlatform: platform. T2 = AnotherClass with:T1. Complicated usingPlatform: platform with: T2] value *) =  ( .. code here .. )

<h5 id="org4ee74bd"><span class="section-number-5">9.3.6.5.</span> What is the purpose of the exemplar on the primary factory method?</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-9-3-6-5">
<p>
Primary purpose of the exemplar on the primary factory method is to provide an instance for life evaluation in the IDE.
</p>

<p>
Generally, the exemplar on the primary factory method would call the primary factory method (to get us an instance and also document the signature), BUT this is not always the case.
</p>

<p>
The overriding purpose of such exemplar is to get an instance whichever way possible, such as getting an instance from the Platform object or from the Ide object.  On top level classes, which expect platform or ide as an argument, such example would be circular.  So, for example, many top level classes have exemplars like this:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org1c699f7">
class CollectionsForPrimordialSoup usingInternalKernel: ik (* :exemplar:  platform collections *) = ( .. slots ..)
</pre>

<pre class="example" id="org2cb1b70">
class Namespacing usingPlatform: p (* :exemplar:  ide namespacing *) = ( .. slots .. )
</pre>

<pre class="example" id="org0a39d46">
class TextModule usingPlatform: p &lt;Platform&gt; (* :exemplar: platform text *) =  ( .. slots .. )
</pre>

<pre class="example" id="org8eb9d96">
class Debugging usingPlatform: platform ide: ide (* :exemplar: ide debugging *) =  ( .. slots .. )
</pre>

<p>
These examples show how to get an instance from the platform, the ide, or similar object available in the IDE.
</p>

<p>
Note: In fact, whether to use this style is still an open question. Do we want the exemplar to be the same object we use in the system, or a distinct copy? What semantic effects might we see in either case as the user experiments with the exemplar?
Using the IDE's own instance makes the system more live, but may allow users to easily shoot themselves in the foot. It was just the easiest thing to do right now. It also has exposed a bug. Changing methods in this case seems to have no effect, unclear why yet.

<h5 id="orge5a43d0"><span class="section-number-5">9.3.6.6.</span> The examplars are evaluated "as if in a Workspace"</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-9-3-6-6">
<p>
The IDE is the metadata interpreter for exemplar comments, and it uses the same namespace similar to what it creates for workspaces to evaluate them.
</p>

<p>
This <code>namespace</code> includes top level classes in the root namespace (Root) as well as things like platform and ide, sort of like the
</p>

<p>
<code>manifest object + platform object + ide object</code>
</p>

<p>
The exact mechanism used right now is that Workspace has a number of methods like #ide, #platform and others, and has a  #doesNotUnderstand: method that looks up names in the root namespace. The code for it looks like this:
</p>

<p>
<code>WorkspaceManager&gt;&gt;Workspace&gt;&gt;# doesNotUnderstand: message</code>
</p>
<pre class="example" id="orgb96c0bf">
protected doesNotUnderstand: message = (
	^Root
		at: message selector
		ifAbsent: [super doesNotUnderstand: message]
)
</pre>

<p>
So calling in Workspace (to be exact, in an instance, e.g. workspace1)
</p>

<p>
<code>workspace1 ide</code>
</p>

<p>
returns (via <b>ide selector -&gt; 'HopscotchWebIDE'</b>)
</p>

<p>
<code>Root at: 'HopscotchWebIDE'</code>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-9-4-1">
<p>
This section describes access control in Newspeak.
</p>

<p>
The main backround source for this section is the online presentation <a href="https://00463064267054129163.googlegroups.com/attach/16b8a25058caa/ns-access-control.pdf?part=0.1&amp;view=1&amp;vt=ANaJVrHvttkWPn-fNP95UFKbcCbbp1VaDJlJSx1HzBevq_xhafVpZ4uz1ffKMTvkAxLFnAk2_xurwU-BTi3FIMnPj1FlU7-S-zKgS2y2eNXheQQsxM8mJUY">Can Beautiful Languages Do Access Control?</a>.  The text here is based on and borrows from the above, but may introduce terminology that is not part of the presentation.
</p>

<p>
Access control is a set of rules for class and object members (accessed items).
</p>

<p>
The access control rules decide whether an expression (a line of code), will be accessible (can be executed) at runtime.
</p>

<p>
The rules take into account 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Access modifiers "private" "public" and default (protected) on the accessed items;</li>
<li>Wheather the accessed items are declared in the same class, nested class or enclosing class of the expression for which the rules evaluate access. In other words, access control rules interact with the lexical structure (nesting) of the classes involved: classes where the code is located, in relation to the classes which are used in the code.</li>
<li>Whether the accessed items are declared in the same class or an inherited class. In other words, access control interacts with inheritance.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Clearly, access control rules are not trivial.  This section attempts to explain them, and provide some practical examples.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org56d189c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org56d189c"><span class="section-number-4">9.4.2.</span> Access control context, description and terminology</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-9-4-2">
<p>
Every expression in Newspeak is a message send.  So let us describe what is meant by the term "Access" or "Access rights" of objA to access objB or objA to send message msg to objB.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Newspeak classes can be nested and also inherited.</li>
<li>Newspeak classes can have the following <b>members</b>: <b>slots, methods, nested classes</b>.</li>
<li>Each <i>member</i> may have access modifiers keywords: public, private. No modifier means protected.</li>
<li>"Access control" describes how objects can access ("have the access rights to") other objects and other objects' members.</li>
<li>The access rights are determined by rules which navigate in three independent "dimensions"
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The "accessibility dimension": Points on this dimension are access modifiers: public, private, protected (default, no keyword)</li>
<li>The "lexical dimension" : Points on this dimension are enclosing and nested classes</li>
<li>The "inheritance dimension" : Points on this dimension are classes on the inheritance chain</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In a Newspeak's (class based) system of objects, each object may contain slots, methods, and nested classes.</li>
<li>Because in Newspeak runtime, any operation is a message send, we can speak of the following: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>At runtime, in Newspeak's system of objects, object objA may or may not be able to reference (see) another object objB.</li>
<li>If objA is not allowed to reference objB, a security exception results.</li>
<li>If objA can reference objB, we say that objA has access (or access rights) to objB. Further, if objA has access to objB, assume there is a method, slot, or nested class named <code>memberB</code> declared on objB. Even though objA has access to objB, objA still may or may not be able to send the message <code>memberB</code> to objB (execute <code>objB memberB</code>). If objA has the ability to send message msg to objB, we say that "object objA has access to memberB on objB"</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>
Combined, we say that objA has <b>access</b> (or <b>access rights</b>) to send a message <code>memberB</code> to <code>objB</code>, if a message send <code>objB memberB</code> is allowed to execute at runtime from some place in code of <code>objA</code>.

<p>
This section goes over access control rules described in the above slides.
</p>

<p>
The core slides are slides 61, 62, 63. They describe how Newspeak code in a class accesses members (classes, slots, methods) above and below the class in the nesting hierarchy and the member members, depending on the accessed member's public, private and protected status.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-9-4-3-2">
<p>
This slide describes how Newspeak code in a class can access private and protected members (classes, slots, methods) above and below the class in the nesting hierarchy:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rule a) Private and protected members can be seen by nested classes</li>

<li>Rule b) Enclosing classes cannot see private or protected members of nested classes</li>

<li>Rule c) Subclasses are never aware of private members of superclasses and vice versa</li>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Rules a) and b) describe <b>lexical scope based access</b> from a class (say named C) to it's nested classe and it's enclosing classes. We can interpret lexical access as 'looking at source code'. If we print the code of the module declaration (the code of a top level class, including all nested classes), and use a finger to browse up and down the enclosing and nested classes, we are using lexical access.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>rule a) can be interpretted as: <b>code in class C can access all members of all classes in the class C’s lexical scope UP</b></li>

<li>rule b) can be interpreted as:  <b>code in class C can only access public members of nested classes in the class C’s lexical scope DOWN</b>.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>We can remember rules a) and b) using <b>Sky and the Ground memoization of rules a) and b)</b> as follows: 

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Imagine looking UP, to the sky: sky is see-through, everything is visible and accessible, all the way to the remote stars.  This can be translated as in our situation <b>all members (private, protected, public) lexically UP are visible and accessible</b>.</li>

<li>Imagine looking DOWN to the ground: the ground stops any visibility below the surface. This can be translated that all private and protected members DOWN below the bottom of our class are invisible.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Rule c) is for inheritance: private members can be only accessed in the class where they are declared.</li>

<p>
Corollary 1: Public member on any class ClC is accessible from anywhere.  By "accessible from anywhere" we mean "any class ClA which can be lexically anywhere" - we can write an expression which contains a public member of ClC in any code in ClA (even if the module where we write the code is different from the module where the public member is declared). 
</p>

<p>
Corollary 2: Non public member on class ClN is only visible from class ClC, if class ClC is nested in ClN.

        )
    )

    protectedFails = (
        ^'protectedFails' 
        (* C1 new protectedFails: Fails. 

        Reason:  I feel the reason is not completely obvious, as we are typing code in the Workspace, and it is not immediately clear how code in Workspace is lexically (nesting wise) related to the class ~C1~. A note: The Newspeak IDE provides a Root namespace, all modules are nested in it. Both the Workspace and the C1 module code are nested in the IDE. Having made that note let's work trough why this message send fails: The workspace context is lexically NOT enclosing C1. The code line that we wrote, ~C1 new protectedFails~ is lexically in the workspace module; the member we are trying to access, ~protectedFails~, is lexically in the C1 module.  In summary, this fails because of rule on slide 63 b: An object (workspace where we type the expression) may access private or protected member (~protectedFails~) only if a) it is a member or b) a lexically visible member of an enclosing class (C1 class is not enclosing to Workspace class). In our situation, the code in expressions ~C1 new protectedFails~ typed in the Workspace class cannot see a private or protected member (~C1&gt;&gt;#protectedFails~) of a class (C1) because the method C1&gt;&gt;#protectedFails is neither a member of  Workspace, nor it is in Workspace's enclosing class.

        Note: As a practical result, because we are testing in the workspace, we will make all our test methods in the C1 class public (for example ~public protC2New~, ~public protC2NewProtM~ and we will investigate the access rules on the expressions inside the methods on ~C1~. We name the methods on C1 so the naming reflects what the tested expression in the method does. For example: the name ~protC2NewProtM~ expresses in the name that we call the expression ~ProtC2 new protM~.  Also there is another important point here: For between-modules visibility: A module C1, looking into another module C2, can only see public members in C2. So C1 must make public any of it's members intended to be used outside of C1 - in other words, C1 module's API methods must be public. 
        *)
    )

    public publicSucceeds = (
        ^'publicSucceeds' 
        (* C1 new publicSucceeds: Success. 

        Reason: A public member (message named ~publicSucceeds~ here) is accessible from any lexical context - 'anywhere in code', even from another module (workspace in this case). 
        *) 
    )

    public protC2 = (
        ProtC2.  
        (* Success. 

        Reason: According to *Slide 63 a, classes are allowed access to all it's members (even private or protected)*. Here, the code is in class C1 (in it's member method ~protC2~), and accesses ~C1~s member nested class ~ProtC2~, so ~ProtC2~ can be accessed. Same would apply if the member nested class was private (~private PrivC2~ instead of ~ProtC2~).

        ^ 'ProtC2'
    )

    public protC2New = (
        ProtC2 new.
        (* Success. 

        Reason: Similar reason as in ~protC2~ in the section above: . There is a fine print reason here we should add (this reason is not spelled out in the slide rules): The rules on member class visibility transfer to their primary factory methods; so the fact that code in ~C1~ can access it's member ~ProtC2~, transforms to ~ProtC2~'s primary factory, ~new~ in this case. In other words, ~C1~ can access it's member ~ProtC2~, implies that  ~C1~ can access it's member's primary factory (method ~new~, fully described as ~C1&gt;&gt;ProtC2&gt;&gt;#new~).

    )

    public protC2NewProtM = (
        ProtC2 new protM.

        (* Fails.
           Reason: We showed success all the way before sending ~protM~; sending ~protM~ (fully specified as ~C1&gt;&gt;ProtC2&gt;&gt;#protM~) fails. The code being executed, ~ProtC2 new protM~ is in class ~C1~. Method ~C1&gt;&gt;ProtC2&gt;&gt;#protM~ is a protected member on ~Prot2~, nested in ~C1~. According to *Slide 62 b) Enclosing classes (code in C1) cannot see private or protected members (protected method ~protM~) of nested classes (~ProtC2~).*. Sending message ~ProtM~ in ~ProtC2 new protM~ fails according to this rule, as expected.
        *)
        ^ 'protC2NewProtM'
    )

    public protC2NewPubM = (
        ProtC2 new pubM. 

        (* Succeeds 
           Reason:  ~pubM~ is public member on a nested class ~ProtC2~ (lexically a member of ~C1~). According to [[* Corollary on slides 61, 62, 63][Corollary on slides 61, 62, 63]] public member (here ~pubM~) is accessible from anywhere (here from ~C1~). Obviously, we have already validated access of the first part of the expression, ~ProtC2 new~.

<p>
Let us describe this class.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>We named the class <code>C1</code>. <code>C1</code> is a top level class (which makes it a module, see the module section). Class  <code>C1</code> is intended to test a limited subset of accessibility scenarios. Note that <code>C1</code> is not marked public. However, in Newspeak, all top level classes are public by default!</li>

<li>Naming:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The strings <b>Prot</b> and <b>Pub</b> in the class names, denotes whether they are declared public or protected. The numbers 1, 2, 3 in the names C1, ProtC2, PubC3 etc express nesting level 'level 1', 'level 2' and 'level 3'.</li>

<li>The naming of the methods, for example <code>protC2ProtM</code> stands for "on protected class C2, protected method" and denotes class's and method's public / protected status for a quick lookup.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><code>C1</code> has 1 nested class, <code>ProtC2</code>  which in turn has 2 nested classes, protected nestd class <code>ProtC3</code> and  public nested class <code>PubC3</code> to test public and protected access. Also,  <code>ProtC3</code> and  <code>PubC3</code>  classes has one public and one protected method, named according to their access status, for example, <code>PubC3&gt;&gt;#pubC3ProtM</code> and  <code>PubC3&gt;&gt;#pubC3PubM</code></li>

<li>The methods just generally return a string with it's name, such as <code>^'protC3ProtM'</code> or return an expression such as <code>ProtC2 new protM</code> which we are testing for accessibility.</li>

<li>When we want to express the level of nesting in text, we may refer names such as <code>C1&gt;&gt;ProtC2&gt;&gt;PubC3&gt;&gt;#pubC3PubM</code></li>

<li>During testing, we will concentrate on why a certain expression evaluation succeeds or fails from the accessibility perspective, and will explain the success or failure based on rules in Slides 61, 62, 63.</li>

<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-access-C1newProtC2New.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Reason: Similar reason as in <code>protC2</code> in the section above: There is a fine print reason here (this reason is not spelled out in the slide rules): The rules on member class visibility transfer to their primary factory methods; so the fact that code in <code>C1</code> can access it's member <code>ProtC2</code>, transforms to <code>ProtC2</code>'s primary factory, <code>new</code> in this case. In other words, if <code>C1</code> can access it's member <code>ProtC2</code>, implies that  <code>C1</code> can access it's member's primary factory (method <code>new</code>, fully described as <code>C1&gt;&gt;ProtC2&gt;&gt;#new</code>).</li>

<li>Does: Creates an instance of class <code>ProtC2</code> and attempts to send protected message <code>protM</code> to it.</li>
<li>Code Result: <b>Fails</b> to send message <code>protM</code>
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-access-C1newProtC2NewProtM.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Reason: We showed success all the way before sending <code>protM</code>; sending <code>protM</code> (fully specified as <code>C1&gt;&gt;ProtC2&gt;&gt;#protM</code>) fails. The code being executed, <code>ProtC2 new protM</code> is in class <code>C1</code>. Method <code>C1&gt;&gt;ProtC2&gt;&gt;#protM</code> is a protected member on <code>Prot2</code>, nested in <code>C1</code>. According to <b>Slide 62 b) Enclosing classes (code in C1) cannot see private or protected members (protected method <code>protM</code>) of nested classes (<code>ProtC2</code>).</b>. Sending message <code>ProtM</code> in <code>ProtC2 new protM</code> fails according to this rule, as expected.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If we make the method we are calling, the <code>C1&gt;&gt;ProtC2&gt;&gt;#protM</code>,  public, then the call to <code>protM</code> in <code>ProtC2 new protM</code> will succeed. We will show it by calling an equivalent but public method <code>C1&gt;&gt;ProtC2&gt;&gt;#pubM</code> in the next section.

<li>Code Result: Succeeds sending public message <code>C1&gt;&gt;ProtC2&gt;&gt;#pubM</code> from code in <code>C1</code>
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-access-C1newProtC2NewPubM.png" alt="nil"/></li>
<li>Reason:  <code>pubM</code> is public member on a nested class <code>ProtC2</code> (lexically a member of <code>C1</code>). According to <a href="#org7b2af5b">Corollary on slides 61, 62, 63</a> public member (here <code>pubM</code>) is accessible from anywhere (here from <code>C1</code>). Obviously, we have already validated access of the first part of the expression, <code>ProtC2 new</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Note: All along during accessibility discussion, we assumed a message in an expression is understood by the receiver, and merely examined whether the code where the expression is, has access to the message.  To make an explicit note in this section:  <code>pubM</code> is a member method on <code>ProtC2</code>, so the instance <code>ProtC2 new</code> does understand <code>pubM</code>.  Here, <code>C1&gt;&gt;ProtC2&gt;&gt;#pubM</code> is accessible from method <code>C1&gt;&gt;#protC2NewPubM</code>, that is all that matters for accessibility evaluation.  The fact that <code>pubM</code> a member (on <code>ProtC2</code>) but that is not relevant in accessibility evaluation, although obviously necessary for understanding.
</p>

<p>
Summary: This section <a href="#org18ec4fb">C1 new protC2NewPubM</a> shows how to 'resolve' the accessibility failure discussed in the previous section. The takeaway is that if a code wants to access members of any nested class, the nested class must make such member public - as we did here (protected <code>protM</code> access failed, changing to public <code>pubM</code> access succeeded).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-6">
<p>
TL;DR: We can create HTML Documents in Newspeak. More precisely, we can create a Document object in Newspeak using the <b>"Add Document"</b> popup action on the "Root-+" button. Such object is a true Newspeak object; it can contain HTML along with Newspeak-defined actions.  The document can be saved (exported) to a HTML file using the <b>Download</b> popup action on the "document-3-dot" button. The exported document can be loaded (imported) back the the IDE using the <b>"Load Document(s)"</b> popup action on the "root-3-dot" button.  Ampleforth is a framework that allows HTML documents to perform actions, implemented as Newspeak methods .
</p>

<p>
The chapters below show the steps in detail.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-9-6-1">
<p>
From the IDE:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>in "Newspeak Source"</li>
<li>click on the "+" beside Root, in the popup, choose "Add Document"</li>
<li>give the document a name</li>
<li>click the "Accept" checkbox.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So far this is equivalent to creating and adding a class, except here we choose "Add Document" rather than "Add Class".

<li>can be fully instantiated as a Newspeak Document by loading it (compiling it) into a running IDE (which does NOT contain the class <code>AMyDocument</code>). This can be done by clicking the "Load document(s)" on the 3-dot menu in
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-load-document-object-saved-as-html.png" alt="nil"/>
which puts the document class back to the IDE

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-7">
<p>
TL;DR: This section collects a few more sophisticated examples, in addition to the introductory <a href="#org4bd3b5c">Hello World in Newspeak - several versions</a>, and the <code>CounterApp</code> in <a href="#orgff12272">Code, run, and debug the CounterApp in Newspeak</a>.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-9-7-1">
<p>
TL;DR: <code>CounterAppWithDependencies</code> is an example of an Application which uses a dependency, the General module <code>ATranslation</code>.  We can download and save the code files from <a href="https://github.com/mzimmerm/newspeak-doc/tree/main/newspeak---a-few-notes-code/counter-app-with-dependencies">https://github.com/mzimmerm/newspeak-doc/tree/main/newspeak---a-few-notes-code/counter-app-with-dependencies</a>.  We use <a href="#org519fcbe">"Compile file(s)"</a> to load the saved files; the loaded class will appear in the IDE. Then we can browse, run, or deploy the Application. This version is in Czech:  <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-counter-app-with-module-dependency-czech.png" alt="nil"/>
</p>


<p>
Note: In this <code>CounterAppWithDependencies</code> example, the translation class <code>ATranslation</code> was written by us, as a General module, NOT a library. We have another example <a href="#org665fb74">4. Hello World Application using 3rd party dependency</a> where the translation class <code>HelloTranslator</code> is wrapped in a Library module <code>HelloTranslatorLib</code> - this mimics a situation where <code>HelloTranslator</code> may NOT be written by us, but by another 3rd party, who packaged packaged  <code>HelloTranslator</code> in  <code>HelloTranslatorLib</code> for distribution.  As a result, the Hello World example is slightly different.

Snippets of wisdom
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Recipy - How to implement what would be static variables in other languages</b>: Anything that you expected to put in a static variable goes in an instance variable of a module. What about singleton classes? How do I ensure that there is only one instance? The easiest way is to initialize a read only slot of a module with an object literal. What happens if there are multiple instances of the module declaration? Well, each module has its own "singleton". That's exactly what happens with singleton classes in Java when they are defined by multiple class loaders.</li>
<li>From <a href="https://bracha.org/newspeak-modules.pdf">https://bracha.org/newspeak-modules.pdf</a> Like Self, all computation - even an object's own access to its internal structure  is performed by invoking methods on objects. Newspeak is class-based. Classes can be nested arbitrarily. Since all names denote method invocations, all classes are virtual; in particular, superclasses are virtual, so all classes act as mixins. Unlike its predecessors, there is no static state in Newspeak, nor is there a global namespace. Modularity in Newspeak is based exclusively on class nesting. There are no separate modularity constructs such as packages. Top level classes act as module definitions, which are independent, immutable, self-contained parametric namespaces. They can be instantiated into modules which may be stateful and mutually recursive.</li>
<li><p>
StringTest&gt;&gt;#testShout is the Smalltalk way of documenting the testShout method of the StringTest class.  When you actually type the code into the browser, you don't have to type the class name or the &gt;&gt;; instead, you just make sure that the appropriate class is selected.  Documentation example in text should show abstract argument names:
</p>
<pre class="example" id="orge5e22ca">
History&gt;&gt;goBackward
  self canGoBackward ifFalse: [self error: 'Already on the first element'].
  stream skip: --2.
  ^ self next.

History&gt;&gt;goTo: aPage
  stream nextPut: aPage.
</pre></li>
<li><p>
Modules (top level class instances) can only access other modules and module declarations (module classes) through <code>a parameter passed in primary factory - the module instantiation method</code>
So this is a module (termed General, see zoo):
</p>
<pre class="example">
class HelloBraveNewWorld usingPlatform: platform = (
  (* This works *)
  platform squeak Transcript open show: 'Hello, Oh Brave new world'.
)
</pre>
<p>
If we had written
</p>
<pre class="example">
class HelloBraveNewWorld = (
  (* This does NOT work *)
  Transcript open show: 'Hello, Oh Brave new world'.
)
</pre>
<p>
and then created an instance via <code>HelloBraveNewWorld new</code> (if a class doesn't specify a message for creating instances, new is the default), we would get a doesNotUnderstand: error, because HelloBraveNewWorld does not understand the message Transcript.  There simply is no way to access the standard output stream, or any other system state, without having it passed in via a parameter when a module is instantiated.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>ide namespacing manifest Collections</code> (* Collections class *)</li>
<li><code>collections</code>  (* instance of CollectionForPrimodialSoup *)</li>
<li><code>(ide namespacing manifest ATranslation) new translate: 'aaa'</code> (* 'cannot translate', good, that means the 'translate:' method was called *)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>If you are learning, make everything public.  everything = each method, slot, and inner class</b>.  It may not be the right thing, but it helps as the error messages are not the best currently.  You will just get "Does not understand" too many times.  First time it took me a day to figure out hehe.</li>
<li>so, basically, if I have an HTML string with a &lt;div class='helpButton'&gt;, this code in ClassPresenter&gt;&gt;helpText:  can insert a Hopscotch(?) instance of  HelpButton (assuming HelpButton was implemented) and the HelpButton instance will present itself as Html on that div? Hmm, maybe that org-to-ampleforth just got more exciting - but I have to hold myselt. &#x2013; answer: Pretty much.  You need to define the mapping from div classes to Newspeak widgets, as ClassPresenter&gt;&gt;helpText: does for the widgets it uses.</li>
<li>Library is an informal term.  Any Newspeak module definition (i.e., a top level class) is a library, and to use, it you call its class methods, most likely to instantiate it. If you want to deploy a module, you need to use it via an app (i.e, define something with #packageUsing: and #main:args:), directly or indirectly.</li>

<p>
TL;DR: I am a perpetual Newspeak beginner.  I have started looking at Newspeak with low intensity early 2010ish.  Then I stopped, and started again around 2021.  When reading discussions with other Newspeak newcomers, I realized there is some common confusion, that (for me) does not seem to be solvable by reading documents.  This section is a collection of information that I hope helps in the understanding of these concepts.  The 
</p>

<p>
Most of my confusion was around terms, principles, concepts, convention methods, etc, which are new or different compared to mainstream languages (including Smalltalk which is not mainstream arguably).  Let's list some of the terms first, then devote a chapter to each. The list below includes terms for: principles (no global namespace), concepts (module, modularity), names of objects that reflect concepts (manifest, platform), method names (<code>#packageUsing: manifest</code>) etc.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>manifest</code></li>
<li><code>platform</code></li>
<li><code>namespace</code></li>
<li><code>module</code> and <b>modularity</b></li>
<li>What role do the <b>convention methods</b> play?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>#packageUsing: manifest</code></li>
<li><code>#packageLibraryUsing: manifest</code></li>
<li><code>#buildUsing: platform</code></li>
<li><code>#main:args</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>
For all the above terms, at some point I kept asking: what does this thing actually mean and do? It is hard! <b>Turns out, maybe not hard at all. But that comes with time.</b>
</p>

<p>
Below are snippets of discussions related to the above concepts (sometimes rephrased, sometimes things added - all errors are mine).

Terminology: Let us call <b>systemPlatform</b> the specific system Newspeak runs on: Wasm, Squeak, etc. These in run on Linux, Mac, Windows, Android. So a <b>systemPlatform</b> may be "Wasm on Linux", but the "on Linux" is not necessary as Wasm has pretty much the same support on all OSes.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-10-2-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is instance of a top-level class</li>

<li>Modules (top-level class instances) are invisible to each other?

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Exactly. This is the result of one Newspeak fundamental design ideas, that make it very different from Smalltalk: "There is no global namespace."</li>
</ul></li>

<li>It has no access to anything except a few basic classes inherited form Object, and whatever is passed into its factory (it need not be platform). The arguments to the factory are capabilities, in the sense of the object-capability security model (ocap). Now to actually build things, <b>you use the IDE as a global namespace</b> to collect the various pieces you need.</li>

<h4 id="org9c6a0b5"><span class="section-number-4">10.2.2.</span> What is a <b>platform</b>?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-10-2-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The platform object reifes the set of standard libraries that one expects to have at any destination.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In a sane world, this would be the complete story. Alas, we live on Earth instead. We can't expect every device to have Newspeak installed. Therefore, we may need to package an application with additional elements, such as the Newspeak platform and a Newspeak VM. We also need to accommodate different packaging formats and technologies, such as operating systems and web browsers.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>It is a also a message supported by the workspace. It returns an object also termed 'platform'.</li>

<li>Is there a way to list what variables are there?

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Yes: type platform and evaluate it (make sure you select 'platform' or type it on a new line, so you don't end up evaluating other stuff in the workspace). Then click on the link, which iwll take you to an object presenter (aka object inspector) on the platform object.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>The platform object also provides the API for all things supported by the infrastructure (systemPlatform) where it is running. This APIs should be implemented by all systemPlatforms where Newspeak runs on.  But it does not lock you in - that's why you have the option of accessing systemPlatform-specific stuff, by going through an accessor method. On the WASM system, that accessor is #js, and it gives you access to Javascript. So it is also something that gives you the only connections to the world outside Newspeak.</li>

<li><p>
Q: It is usually used in factory method slot declarations, such as
</p>
<pre class="example">
class AClass usingPlatform: platform  = (
  |
  (* imports *)
  private Map = p collections Map.
  private Presenter = p hopscotch Presenter.
  |
)
</pre>
<p>
Why do you not just store the Platform object itself in a slot, and only ask it for these other objects when you need them?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A: You could do that, but that would be bad coding style.  Newspeak is largely about modularity; this is a big part of that story. The code above acts (as the comment says) as a series of imports of classes that the module depends on.  If you store the individual modules as above then you (and the system) know, looking at the factory, exactly what the module's dependencies are. If you store the entire platform, you don't know what you're using; it's like a Java program (or a Smalltalk program, for that matter).</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Improved platform story. You might have noticed an annoying quirk in the various GUI apps, where the app has to set up a Hopscotch-enabled platform in its #main:args: method.  This deviation from Goodthink has been eradicated. The old HopscotchForHTML5Runtime class is gone. Instead, RuntimeForHopscotchForHTML provides a proper platform that one can deploy Hopscotch apps to, and these apps no longer need to anything special/convoluted to use Hopscotch. The apps and build script have been updated accordingly.</li>

<li>Q: At which step of the lifecycle would the <code>AnApplication&gt;&gt;#packageUsing: manifest</code> and <code>ALibrary&gt;&gt;#packageUsing: manifest</code> method be used (invoked), where, by whom?

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A: Those "convention methods" should be given to Applications and Libraries to be given special way to instantiate for packaging.  They would be invoked as a step to build an Application or Library object for distribution (answering lifecycle), by the IDE (answering by whom) on the source system (answering where).  Their invocation would be followed by serializing the object, which would be saved as a .vfuel file for distribution. We could serialize the object in different serialization and distribution formats, and different assumptions about presence of dependencies on the target system. .vfuel file is the main format. The IDE uses the presence of this method (solely) to determine the module is an Application, and displayes on the class line, the [run][debug][deploy] actions.  The action code after clicking on [deploy] -&gt; asVictoryFuel(WithMirrors) starts with invoking this method, followed by serialization of the Application object this method creates.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>During creation of a software artifact, all the dependencies of the artifact have to be made available by getting them to the <b>development site</b> or <b>build site</b> (where the <b>build scripts</b> will run). This is <b>commonly addressed by package managers</b> (mz - e.g. zypper install, apt, flutter pub get, pull dependencies from the web to the "build site" - my system - where I want to create and build my newly-coded package). That much is true in Smalltalk as well. In Smalltalk you put these in your image, which provides a global namespace; in most other systems you put them in the file system, which again, is a global namespace.  In Newspeak, you put them in the IDE, which as a global namespace as well. I am hoping to avoid the plague of package managers; the IDE should be able to do this based on some metadata conventions.</li>

<li>Next, there is the question of how you put together your program from the available artifacts, given the global namespace. This is the domain of <b>build scripts</b> in traditional software. In Newspeak, you can write these scripts in Newspeak itself.  These would take a <b>namespace object</b> (we often call a <b>manifest</b>) as a parameter. You'd <b>typically pass in the IDE top level namespace</b>. Of course, you can always override the behavior of a given manifest by wrapping it.</li>

<li>So you write class with a <code>#packageLibraryUsing: manifest</code> method that takes a manifest and instantiates your library as you wish. The manifest needs have all the code you need. Importantly, the manifest is still under 'end user control' and should contain only top level classes (we can also enforce that) so no state or access to the outside world is provided. <b>Thus, the #packageLibraryUsing: methods are like build scripts</b>, and they can call other <code>#packageLibraryUsing: manifest</code> methods, <b>just like build scripts or makefiles refer to others</b>. The difference being that none of this is hardwired to a specific global namespace.</li>

<li>The above deserves reiterating: Despite the name, the <b>"#packageLibraryUsing: manifest" methods are like <i>build scripts</i></b>! mz - And, the <b>"#buildUsing: platform" methods are like loading a module provided by the library into memory and linking it to application</b>! See the next section on <code>#buildUsing: platform</code></li>

<li>And if I write software library that depends on 20 or 30 third party libraries, I'll have to write a factory with 30 specific arguments?

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No, you can aggregate them into an object (a manifest or submanifest, or even something else), and pass that into the  <code>#packageLibraryUsing: myManifest</code>.  That way clients of your library will not break when you add 31st 3rd party library to your library. Also note that in many cases, you will write factories that take actula module instances rather than classes as arguments.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>The "convention methods" names for a Newspeak Library, are confusing: they use the method name starting with the word "package" for a step which is in traditional software termed "build(script)", and they use the method name starting with the word "build" for a step which is in traditional software termed "loading" or "linking".

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>package(Library)Using: manifest   performs work similar to build scripts to build for deployment</b> - factory method</li>

<li><b>buildUsing: platform              perform work similar to loading and linking</b> - instance method</li>

<li>The argument to the factory is the manifest, which is a namespace object where all the dependencies of the application can be found. The factory method of the application is analogous to its build script. To deploy an application, you serialize  it (exactly in the sense of object serialization) so that you can then transport it elsewhere, where you can deserialize it, obtaining a live object; then you call #main:args: and run it. Again, it's just like shipping executable. Deserializing is like loading.</li>

Details:
</p>

<p>
The <code>#buildUsing: platform</code> was proposed specifically for the library distribution scenario rather than the application distribution scenario.  It's role is analogous to <code>#main:args</code>. You distribute the library, as you distribute the application, as an object with its dependencies (excluding the platform), all serialized.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You produce (build) the application (respectively library) object using <code>#packageUsing:</code> (resp. <code>#packageLibraryUsing:</code>).</li>
<li>You then instantiate the application (respectively module object provided by the library object) using <code>#main:args:</code> (resp. <code>#buildUsing:</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>
At that the first stage (dev time on source system) you provided a manifest, a global namespace of the classes you need. At the second stage (load time on target system) you provide a <code>platform</code> that ties this code to the standard libraries that provide access to real world capabilities.

<h4 id="org0c18aea"><span class="section-number-4">10.2.9.</span> What are serialization methods and formats?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-10-2-9">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can the 'program package' in Newspeak be something else than a vfuel file?

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A: Yes. Example: you compile the application into Javascript. This too is a way to serialize the application object.  Or you might want to deploy your code as an Electron app, packaged as a MacOS application or a Window application, and these may each have variations (are they to be signed for app store use?; are they to include the Newspeak code as vfuel along with a WASM VM, or as Javascript? etc.). More on this below.</li>

<li>As noted above, there are any number of formats. At the very core, there is a serialized Newspeak object. For a CounterApp, this would be <code>100Kb. But because we ship the ~platform</code> code in a vfuel, we get to about 1Mb. Once we add the engine (300K WASM) and other resources, things grow further, and we are distributing something like zipped directory (e.g. server.zip on the downloads page). If we wrap that in an Electron app, and wrap that in a MacOS app, we have 70Mb zipped, or 175Mb unzipped, because we now are shipping Chromium as well.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I can place .vfuel under a webserver and run the CounterApp, but can I, for example, export some other artifact (zip file with binary or source?) that is later loaded into another persons Newspeak IDE?

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A: In principle, yes, there are other ways to serialize an application. In earlier versions, we would serialize an app without the platform code. This results in very small files (say 100Kb, depending on the app). The IDE (this was the old Smalltalk based system)  would deserialze the app object into a regular Newspeak object in memory. In an ideal world, this is all you would need. Alas, this requires a Newspeak engine to be useful, and we cannot realistically assume this. <b>So, the current vfuel files include the entire platform code in them</b>.  Now, since many apps do not require features such as reflection, and reflection tends to greatly increase the footprint of the vfuel file (because we must include source code as well as the mirror module) we have <b>options to create vfuels with or without mirrors</b>. The idea of <b>deployment/serialization configurations</b> is to generalize this, so one can describe deployments of varying kinds. This is not really properly supported yet. But you can see that there is a large number of combinations (JS or WASM; GUI or non-GUI; mirrors or no mirrors; MacOS, Windows, ChromeOS, iOS, Android; Electron or PWA) not all of which are valid of course.</li>

Newspeak doesn't have an image.  So what do I actually do to develop software? I mean, I presume I run a copy of Newspeak somehow, and start adding classes to it.  But then where / how do my additions get saved if there isn't an image? When I've added a couple of classes to a running Newspeak environment, I presume they don't just disappear when I switch my computer off? So where do they go? Or where do I put them?

<p>
Changes in Newspeak are always saved locally, as long as you click the "Accept" button after making changes.
</p>

<p>
It won't save your state, but it will save your code.  Bear in mind that the web-based system is young and will crash occasionally, but also that <b>the system saves your changes as backup regardless of whether you saved explicitly</b>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-5">
<p>
As discussed in <a href="#org24da67d">Dependencies and modularity: Important but hard to "get" at firsty</a>:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Due to Newspeak's modularity, the process of bringing dependencies into a Newspeak program is different from mainstream language platforms.</li>
<li>The <code>manifest</code> object, passed to <i>primary factory</i> of Application and Library, provides the ability to bring dependencies into modules for packaging.  The <code>platform</code> object, passed to convention instance methods to the Application and Library objects, provides runtime objects expected to be found on all Newspeak platforms (on all Newspeak deployments).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Folow the above link and also the <a href="#org4bd3b5c">Hello World in Newspeak - several versions</a> section for concrete examples of bringing dependencies.
</p>

<p>
Text below provides the example introduced by Gilad Bracha on the Newspeak Google groups list: <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/newspeaklanguage/c/kHAIE_i7gTc/m/p3RYdQ5OBQAJ">https://groups.google.com/g/newspeaklanguage/c/kHAIE_i7gTc/m/p3RYdQ5OBQAJ</a>
</p>

<p>
Imagine a convention whereby <b>every library intended for distribution is sent out as a class which:</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>has a factory (or in general, class method) method <code>#packageLibraryUsing: manifest</code></li>
<li>has a (build) <code>#buildUsing: platform</code> method - this method, given a platform object, produces a working instance of the module we actually want to distribute</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now developer A (Alice) intends to distribute a module MyMod1.
It depends on some other code she developed, say, MyMod2, which in turn depends on a 3rd party library from developer B (Bob).
The module Alice distributes is below.
</p>

<pre class="example">
class MyMod1DistributionLib packageLibraryUsing: manifest = ( 
 (* packageManager: ...  metadata describing the expected dependencies *)
  |
  MyMod1 = manifest MyMod1.
  MyMod2 = manifest MyMod2.
  my3rdPartyDep = manifest My3rdPartyDep packageLibraryUsing: manifest.
  |
) (
   public buildUsing: platform = (
      |
      my3rdPartDependency = my3rdPartyDep buildUsing: platform.
      myMod2 = MyMod2 usingPlatform: platform and: my3rdPartDependency.
      myMod1 = MyMod1 usingPlatform: platform mod2: myMod2.
      |
     (* IMPORTANT: buildUsing: returns the General module instance NOT this MyMod1DistributionLib
                   library instance - the library is only vehicle to build and return
                   the module we are distributing!!
     *)
     ^myMod1
   )
)
</pre>

<p>
The Library instance method <code>#buildUsing: platform</code> encapsulates the knowledge of how to build Alice's code, using an internal library she wrote (MyMod2) and Bob's library.  
</p>

<p>
Note that Alice is using the same convention as Bob, and builds Bob's code with no knowledge of its internal dependencies.
Developer C (Carol) uses these same conventions to build Alice's code.  She can do so regardless of whether
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>she is <b>building an app</b> : she'd call the Library factory <code>AlicesMyMod1DistributionLib&gt;&gt;#packageLibraryUsing: manifest</code> from the app's factory (from the <code>CarolsApp&gt;&gt;#packageUsing: manifest</code>), and call <code>AlicesMyMod1DistributionLib&gt;&gt;#buildUsing: platform</code> from the app's <code>CarolsApp&gt;&gt;#main: platform args: args</code></li>
<li>or she is <b>building another library</b>: where she'd call <code>AlicesMyMod1DistributionLib&gt;&gt;#packageLibraryUsing:manifest</code> from the library factory (from the <code>CarolsLibrary&gt;&gt;#packageLibraryUsing:manifest</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
If Alice decides to replace Bob's code with code from developer D (David), she changes MyModules, but Carol's code does not change.  Likewise, if Bob or David change their dependencies, neither Alice nor Carol change their code.
</p>

<p>
It isn't necessary for everyone to follow the exact same convention - what's critical is that a given module maintains its convention so its build API is stable.  Of course, a common convention is good, especially for tools. 
</p>

<p>
Alice could just distribute an instance of MyModules, but this hard-wires the versions of all the dependencies.  Assuming she doesn't do that, it is true that Carol needs to download all the pieces and their sub-pieces from Bob and Alice etc.  She loads them into the IDE (or the IDE does so by reading the metadata) and the IDE's namespace is used to produce the manifest object passed in when anyone builds an app.
</p>

<p>
Note that <code>platform</code> and <code>manifest</code> need are quite different.  Manifests are a development thing.  Platforms are a deployment thing.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>Platforms</code> are for runtime capabilities and are security critical.  The platform is something that gives you the only connections to the world outside Newspeak.</li>
<li><code>Manifest</code> are for code construction (see <code>#packageUsing: manifest</code>).  The Newspeak IDE provides a global namespace, which is a real object that you can pass around.  That object is a manifest.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Anyway, hopefully this helps to answer the question.

Why will you refresh? Apart from the odd crash, the more common problem is the performance issues that have been discussed in this forum in December/January.  Basically, we have an unresolved problem that the system slows down painfully under prolonged/heavy use.  Refreshing and loading from backup works fairly well.  This is obviously unacceptable as you lose IDE state (debuggers, workspace/inspector contents, unsaved editors, presenter state such as what method presenters are expanded or collapsed) but it's better than an unresponsive (sluggish to dead) system.

TL;DR: Newspeak has a module which allows to present the Newspeak objects (the IDE, classes, instances, workspaces etc) live in any suitably marked up HTML page. This results in an experience of a live document and a literate program - a document containing multiple program snippets or whole programs. The program(s) snippet(s) inside the document can be changed, changing the results right inside the document. The program can also be explored (introspected), drilled into, etc. Everything described in this section can be played with in any of the above links:

</ul>

<p>
The last link also shows instructions on how to create an emacs org mode document which, after export to HTML (C-c C-e), supports such lively HTML interaction.
</p>

<p>
<b>Let's describe the TL;DR: in more details.</b>
</p>

<p>
The module providing the experience a live document and a literate Newspeak program is called <code>Ampleforth</code>.
</p>

<p>
Ampleforth is already described in <a href="https://blog.bracha.org/illiterateProgramming/out/illiterateProgramming.html">https://blog.bracha.org/illiterateProgramming/out/illiterateProgramming.html</a> by it's author Gilad Bracha. That is definitely the reference description!
</p>

<p>
This section starts from a slightly different angle.
</p>

<p>
The Newspeak module <code>AmpleforthEmbedder</code> (source in AmpleforthEmbedder.ns) is responsible for "presenting" Newspeak objects to HTML, and user interaction with the objects. The module, <code>Ampleforth</code> is simply a wrapper, wrapping <code>AmpleforthEmbedder</code> as a Newspeak application.
</p>

<p>
The liveliness in HTML pages is provided by <code>Ampleforth.js</code>, which is converted from <code>Ampleforth.ns</code> to Javascript.
</p>

<p>
When <code>Ampleforth.js</code> is placed at the end of any HTML page, it works as follows:
</p>

<p>
After the HTML is opened in a browser, the included script with  <code>Ampleforth.js</code> looks for &lt;div&gt; elements with specific class names, and inserts Newspeak objects converted to HTML in thos places.
</p>

<p>
For example, if the HTML contains a div with <code>class="evaluator"</code>, such as
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-html">&lt;<span style="color: #fce94f;">div</span> <span style="color: #fcaf3e;">class</span>=<span style="color: #e9b96e;">"evaluator"</span> expression = <span style="color: #e9b96e;">"11+22"</span>&gt; &lt;/<span style="color: #fce94f;">div</span>&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<code>Ampleforth.js</code> evaluates the expression, then inserts Newspeak result objects converted to HTML to the page (before, after, or instead of such specific elements). The 
</p>

<p>
The HTML is processed in the following call sequence: <code>AmplefortEmbeddor&gt;&gt;#start</code> -&gt; <code>AmplefortEmbeddor&gt;&gt;#processEvaluators</code> and the methods that follow.
</p>

<p>
Here is the relevant code:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd5d923c">
(* AmplefortEmbeddor&gt;&gt;#start *)
public start = (
  processEvaluators.
  processMinibrowsers.
  processClassPresenters.
)

(* AmplefortEmbeddor&gt;&gt;#processEvaluators *)
public processEvaluators = (
  domElementsWithClass: 'evaluator' do:
    [:element |
    | 
    expression = element getAttribute: 'expression'. 
    om &lt;ObjectMirror&gt; = platformMirror. 
    es = EvaluatorSubject onModel: (EvaluationViewState onModel: om).
    |
    es initialSource: expression.
    es evaluateLive: expression.
    EmbeddedHopscotchWindow
      into: element
      openSubject: es].
)
</pre>

<p>
In the above code we see that for each <code>domElementsWithClass:</code> 'evaluator' found in the HTML, the code will look for contents of attribute named <code>expression</code>. The <code>expression</code> contents is evaluated, then the result of evaluation is passed to EmbeddedHopscotchWindow which is inserted to the DOM after the &lt;div&gt; with class 'evaluator'.
</p>

<p>
So, as long as the HTML contains a div with class <code>evaluator</code>, such as
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-html">&lt;<span style="color: #fce94f;">div</span> <span style="color: #fcaf3e;">class</span>=<span style="color: #e9b96e;">"evaluator"</span> expression = <span style="color: #e9b96e;">"11+22"</span>&gt; &lt;/<span style="color: #fce94f;">div</span>&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
the above code (or rather it's converted Javascript equivalent <code>Ampleforth.js</code>) evaluates the expression <code>11+22</code>, creates a <code>EmbeddedHopscotchWindow</code> from the evaluated result. The <code>EmbeddedHopscotchWindow</code> then embeds the result (instance of Number 33 presented as a div) in the DOM inside the original div.
</p>

<p>
We can look in the browser debugger how the result looks after the result div is inserted. After evaluating 11+22, the result 33 is inserted in it's own &lt;a href&gt; link:
</p>


<div id="org7fcdc7a" class="figure">
<p><img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-ampleforth-evaluator-expression-in-debuger.png" alt="nil"/>
</p>
</div>


<p>
Not only that, clicking on the 33 link leads to Newspeak class presenting the instance of 33! See TL;DR for links.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="org7e3d14b"><span class="section-number-3">10.11.</span> How does Newspeak displays itself in DOM and HTML?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-11">
<p>
In addition to the <code>Ampleforth</code> class which can "insert" Newspeak elements live in any HTML page, there is a method that does a similar work for the purpose of presenting Newspeak IDE elements in the browser (when we run the IDE).
</p>

<p>
This method that does this work is <code>HopscotchForHTML5&gt;&gt;Presenter#:ampleforth: h &lt;String&gt; mapping: m &lt;Map[String, Fragment]&gt;</code>. It is responsible for presenting the whole Newspeak IDE as HTML.
</p>

<p>
Let us look at this method first, before we look at an example of it's application: 
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org906f925">
ampleforth: h &lt;String&gt; mapping: m &lt;Map[String, Fragment]&gt; = (
  ^AmpleforthFragment html: h mapping: m
  )
</pre>

<p>
<b>To investigate how <code>HopscotchForHTML5&gt;&gt;Presenter&gt;&gt;#:ampleforth:mapping:</code> results in presenting something in the IDE (that is, in the DOM) on an example, let us look at the <code>Browsing&gt;&gt;ObjectPresenter</code> class in the <code>Browsing.ns</code> module.</b>
</p>

<p>
We will show how clicking on the "Help" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-help-button.png" alt="nil"/> on an object will call a method of <code>Browsing&gt;&gt;ObjectPresenter&gt;&gt;helpText</code>, and how this results in presenting the help text in the IDE.
</p>

<p>
The <code>ObjectPresenter</code> class provides a viewer for objects in the IDE. An example of <code>Browsing&gt;&gt;ObjectPresenter</code>'s work is result of clicking on the "Help" button <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-help-button.png" alt="nil"/> on an object.
</p>

<p>
For the <code>Browsing&gt;&gt;ObjectPresenter</code> to be used, we need a place in the IDE where we see a blue link which presents an object (rather than for example class, which would use Browsing&gt;&gt;ClassPresenter). Go to "Workspaces" where we see a situation similar to
</p>


<div id="org806eeb1" class="figure">
<p><img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-workspaces.png" alt="nil"/>
</p>
</div>

<p>
This shows instance of an object. To activate <code>Browsing&gt;&gt;ObjectPresenter&gt;&gt;helpText</code>, click on the <img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-help-button.png" alt="nil"/> beside Workspace1. The help coming from the ObjectPresenter shows:
</p>

<p>
<img src="/img/newspeak---a-few-notes.org-help-from-object-presenter.png" alt="nil"/>
(we cut the text here)
</p>

<p>
Let us investigate how the Newspeak IDE arrives at presenting the above shown help in the IDE's DOM. As mentioned above, the core of this functionality is the method <code>HopscotchForHTML5&gt;&gt;Presenter&gt;&gt;#:ampleforth: h &lt;String&gt; mapping: m &lt;Map[String, Fragment]&gt;</code> .
</p>

<p>
But we need to start one level above to explore this step by step:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Open code for <code>Browsing&gt;&gt;ObjectPresenter&gt;&gt;#helpText</code>.</li>

<li><p>

  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  You can enter and evaluate Newspeak expressions in the editor pane below. They will be evaluated in the scope of the object being inspected. Shift-Return evaluates the currently selected text; if no text is selected, the current line (i.e., the line where the cursor is) is evaluated. You can also initiate evaluation of any selected text by pressing: &lt;div class = "evaluateSelectionButton"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; which is located above the editor on the left.

The editor can also evaluate at every keystroke; you can toggle this behavior using &lt;div class = "invertEvalStatusButton"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Evaluation results, if any, are displayed below the editor pane. Each result is a link; clicking on it takes you an object inspector on the result.  You can clear the results list by pressing the clear button to its right: &lt;div class="hopscotchClearResultsButton"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If  there are no results to display, the  results list area is blank. Below the results list you will typically see the slots of the object listed; this the basic view of objects. Some objects, such as integers or strings, have customized views. An object can have multiple views (and you can define new views as well). If there are multiple views, tab links appear underneath the results list, and you can select between them.' mapping: mapping

<li>In the code, we can see how it first prepares a <code>mapping</code> map, then returns a result of message send to self <code>ampleforth: aHTMLString mapping: mapping</code>. The message accepts the long pure HTML string we see above, and the mapping.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In the Html snippet, we can find references to 'special' class names:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>&lt;div class="hopscotchClearResultsButton"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;div class="classExpander"&gt;</code></li>
<li>.. etc ..</li>
<li>Note those class names (e.g. classExpander) are equivalent to the 'special' class name evaluator used by AmpleforthEmbedder, in the section <a href="#org1e34df8">10.10</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Clearly those class names are keys in the <code>mappings</code> map.
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org9695521">
mapping 
  at: #hopscotchClearResultsButton put: subject evaluator presenter clearResultsButton;
  at: #classExpander put: classExpansionLink;
  .. etc ..
</pre></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
We can look at "find references" on this method, and find it is defined by <code>HopscotchForHTML5&gt;&gt;Presenter&gt;&gt;#ampleforth:mapping:</code>
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org2e5e1c3">
ampleforth: h &lt;String&gt; mapping: m &lt;Map[String, Fragment]&gt; = (
  ^AmpleforthFragment html: h mapping: m
)
</pre>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Also note that from the ObjectPresenter primary factory method it is clear ObjectPresenter implements ProgrammingPresenter which implements Presenter where the method <code>HopscotchForHTML5&gt;&gt;Presenter&gt;&gt;#ampleforth:mapping:</code> is defined.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>
The above method constructs instance of <code>HopscotchForHTML5&gt;&gt;AmpleforthFragment</code> as follows
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org56cac2c">
public class AmpleforthFragment html: h &lt;String&gt; mapping: m &lt;Map[String, Fragment]&gt; = HTMLFragment html: h (
  |
  mapping &lt;Map[String, Fragment]&gt; = m.
    document_slot &lt;Alien[Document]&gt;
  |
    processMappings.
)
</pre></li>

<li><p>
In turn the <code>HopscotchForHTML5&gt;&gt;AmpleforthFragment&gt;&gt;#processMappings</code> does the following work - the core of the work is call the method <code>#visual</code> on all Fragments in the <code>mappings</code>:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org19d7157">
public processMappings = (
  mapping keysAndValuesDo: [:k &lt;String&gt; :v &lt;Fragment&gt; |
    v parent: self.
  	domElementsWithClass: k do:
  		[:element | element appendChild: v visual]
  ]
)
</pre></li>

<li><p>
The <code>#visual</code> simply calls <code>#createVisual</code> and decorates it. But where is <code>#createVisual</code> defined?  
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org3e990b3">
public visual = (
  visualX isNil ifTrue: [visualX:: decorate: createVisual].
  ^visualX
)
</pre></li>
<li>which in turn calls <code>HopscotchForHTML5&gt;&gt;Fragment&gt;&gt;createVisual</code>, then decorates the visual result.</li>
<li><p>
The important item here is
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org4b28fb7">
createVisual = (
  subclassResponsibility
)
</pre></li>
<li><p>
which is implemented in a large number of <code>Fragment</code> subclasses, such as:
</p>
<pre class="example" id="orgd7a77f8">
createVisual in CheckboxFragment in HopscotchForHTML5
createVisual in ColorPickerFragment in HopscotchForHTML5
createVisual in DatePickerFragment in HopscotchForHTML5
createVisual in PickerFragment in HopscotchForHTML5
createVisual in ProgressBarFragment in HopscotchForHTML5
createVisual in RadioButtonFragment in HopscotchForHTML5
createVisual in RectangleFragment in HopscotchForHTML5
</pre></li>

<li><p>
From the last list, we can see those are all UI elements- checkboxes, pickers, radio buttons etc. Their concrete <code>createVisual</code> implementations use the document object to create a representation of UI elements which are clearly equivalent to DOM object, and can be converted to DOM objects. Let's look at <code>CheckboxFragment#createVisual</code> as an example:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd2f93cd">
createVisual = (
    | 
    container &lt;Alien[Div]&gt; = document createElement: 'div'.
    label &lt;Alien[Element]&gt; = document createTextNode: text.
    |

  container at: 'id' put: 'CheckboxContainer'.

    (container at: 'style')
        at: 'display' put: 'flex';
        at: 'flex-direction' put: 'row';
        at: 'align-items' put: 'center';
        at: 'justify-content' put: 'flex-start'.

    checkbox:: document createElement: 'input'. 
    checkbox
        at: 'type' put: 'checkbox';
        at: 'checked' put: checked;
        at: 'oninput' put: [:event |    
            checked:: checked not.
            holder isNil ifFalse: [         
                holder value: checked.
            ].
            action isNil ifFalse: [
                action value: checked.
            ].
            false
        ].
    container appendChild: checkbox.

    container appendChild: label.

    (checkbox at: 'style')
        at: 'min-width' put: styleCheckboxSize;
        at: 'min-height' put: styleCheckboxSize;
        at: 'margin-right' put: '5px'.

    ^container.

</pre></li>
</ol>

<p>
Seeing the creation of an Alien DOM &lt;div&gt; equivalent object in this last method, we conclude our discovery of "How does Newspeak displays itself in DOM and HTML?"
</p>

<p>
<b>Summary of the discovery:</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
The <code>#helpText</code> contains a (almost) pure HTML and <code>mappings</code> of special class names such as <code>hopscotchClearResultsButton</code>, <code>classExpander</code>, etc.
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org599b719">
mapping 
  at: #hopscotchClearResultsButton put: subject evaluator presenter clearResultsButton;
  at: #classExpander put: classExpansionLink;
  .. etc ..
</pre></li>
<li>We saw the <code>#helpText</code>, by calling <code>#ampleforth:mapping:</code>  created and returned an instance of class <code>HopscotchForHTML5&gt;&gt;ApleforthFragment</code></li>
<li>During creation, in it's factory <code>HopscotchForHTML5&gt;&gt;AmpleforthFragment class&gt;&gt;#html:mapping:</code> applies on each value from <code>mapping</code> the <code>HopscotchForHTML5&gt;&gt;Fragment&gt;&gt;#createVisual</code> at the end of the chain - building the DOM-like objects (called Fragments). Those visual instances are then inserted in the DOM, putting together the Newspeak IDE!.</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>Conclusion of sequence of calls from the "Help button" click to create DOM elements with Help contents</b>
</p>

<p>
We followed the sequence of method calls after the "Help button" was clicked:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>Browsing&gt;&gt;ObjectPresenter&gt;&gt;#helpText</code>                             - calls Presenter self by returning:</li>
<li><code>HopscotchForHTML5&gt;&gt;Presenter&gt;&gt;#ampleforth:mapping:</code>               - Presenter constructs and returns a Fragment <code>^AmpleforthFragment html: h mapping: m</code> by calling:</li>
<li><code>HopscotchForHTML5&gt;&gt;AmpleforthFragment class&gt;&gt;#html:mapping:</code>      - This AmpleforthFragment constructor does the core of the DOM-like child fragments creation by looping through mappings in:</li>
<li><code>HopscotchForHTML5&gt;&gt;AmpleforthFragment&gt;&gt;#processMappings</code>          - For each mapping entry, one visual is created from "entry value" in the calls below; once the visual is returned back here, it is immediately inserted here into element with class="entry key" into <code>domElementsWithClass</code></li>
<li><code>HopscotchForHTML5&gt;&gt;Fragment&gt;&gt;#visual</code>                             - which calls "#createVisual" below</li>
<li><code>CheckboxFragment#createVisual</code>                                    - This uses "document createElement" to create, for each mapping entry, and return an Alien DOM &lt;div&gt; equivalent - it contains a DOM element such as a checkbox.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We saw how this sequence is responsible of presenting Help Text (with embedded Newspeak objects) as an navigatable live HTML browser-presented in the IDE, where we can explore and drill in instances, classes, or other Newspeak artifacts.

<p>
<b>Hopscotsch is the Newspeak module used to write UIs in Newspeak.</b> The version of Hopscotch used in today's (year 2021) Newspeak is called <b>Hopscotch for HTML5</b>.  It is implemented in classes nested in the module's class (top level class) named <code>HopscotchForHTML5</code>.
</p>

<p>
The intent of this chapter is to discover things about <code>HopscotchForHTML5</code> mostly by browsing it's code in the IDE, plus some previously developed intuition :)
</p>

<p>
I am trying to make the process of this chapter to be like discovering things about nature by observation. In our discovery, observation = browsing code only the Newspeak IDE. By observing, we should be able to extract knowledge and make generalizations and predictions.  In our discovery, extract knowledge = understand the core API;  make generalizations and predictions = be able to write a simple UI Application of our own.
</p>

<p>
Note: One important discovery tool is missing - in the current Newspeak, debugging anything in the UI is impossible, due to some known bugs.
</p>

<p>
In other words, during our discovery process in this chapter:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most of the information should come from browsing through the Newspeak IDE in the top level class <code>HopscotchForHTML5</code>.</li>

<li>The end goal of our process is to write a simple Newspeak Application with UI in Hopscotch. This simple Newspeak Application is developed in chapter <a href="#org9e7d08e">Using Hopscotch discovery a Model-Presenter-Subject Application, the <b>CheckedItemApp</b></a>.</li>

<li>There was also the benefit of previously looking at the <code>CounterApp</code> (aka cheating), but as much as possible, we are trying to extract everything we need from the "first principles" of browsing the Newspeak IDE top level class <code>HopscotchForHTML5</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Two most important nested classes in <code>HopscotchForHTML5</code> are <code>Subject</code>, <code>Presenter</code>.  This statement did not come necessarily from observation (although we could claim that), but from a bit of a "previously developed intuition", as well as from the paper "Hopscotch: Towards User Interface Composition" by Vassili Bykov, 8 pages <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.478.1098&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.478.1098&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a>. Note that the paper is about the original Hopscotch, not the HTML5 specific version. But I feel the core of the two versions seems close enough to start with the paper.
</p>


<p>
So this chapter makes a reasonable assumption that the <code>Subject</code> and <code>Presenter</code> classes are of core importance in building UIs in Newspeak. Further, opening class <code>Presenter</code> in the Newspeak IDE, we see that it has a parent class <code>Fragment</code>.  <code>Fragment</code> is new to the new version <code>HopscotchForHTML5</code> as opposed to the original <code>Hopscotch</code>.  Because we consider <code>Presenter</code> important, so must be <code>Fragment</code>. 
</p>

<p>
So, enough meta talk, and let us browse the most important code of classes  <code>Subject</code> and <code>Presenter</code> - their <b>primary factory methods</b>. As with any Newspeak class, we should start at the primary factory methods to understand the class. Primary factory method is the only code which defines slots (slots as similar to members in other OO languages). Also we see that Fragment is parent of Presenter. So <code>Fragment</code> must be important; we added it's primary factory method to the constructor summary as well.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org4551ce1">
public class Subject onModel: aModel = (
  |
	public model = aModel.
  presenterSlot &lt;Presenter&gt;
  public helpActive &lt;Boolean&gt; ::= false.
  |)

public class Presenter onSubject: aSubject &lt;Subject&gt; = Fragment (
  |
  public subject &lt;Subject&gt; ::= aSubject.
  substanceSlot &lt;Fragment&gt;
  public generation &lt;Number&gt; = uiGeneration.
  |)

class Fragment = (
  |
	visualX
	public parent
	public size ::= nil.
	public expansibility ::= 0.
	public compressibility ::= 0.
	decorators
	|)  
</pre>

<p>
From the primary factory methods, it is immediately clear that:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>For a subject to be created, a model is required. So model must be created before subject.</li>
<li>For a presenter to be created, a subject is required. So subject must be created before presenter.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org04005b5" class="outline-4">

<b>Lifecycle of any Hopscotch UI code:</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>We need to instantiate a Model first.</b></li>
<li><b>We need to instantiate a Subject on the model next.</b></li>
<li><b>We need to instantiate a Presenter on the subject last.</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
This is quite clear from the signatures of those classes primary factory methods - there can be no other way.
</p>

<p>
A note on Newspeak syntax: while the <code>Subject&gt;&gt;model</code> slot and <code>Presenter&gt;&gt;subject</code> slots are public, they have no setters, so they are final. The value they acquire in the primary factory method cannot be changed. This is because the slots are defined using " = ", for example in <code>public model = aModel.</code> If the " ::= " was used instead of " = " to define the slot <code>model</code>, then the slot  would not be final - a setter would exist. But as is, we cannot, even in principle, create the instances of Model/Subject/Presenter with null slots, change the creation order, and set the slots later.
</p>

<p>
Next two chapters will look into details of <b>Presenter, Subject, and Model</b> classes, and associations between them.  The associations may not be important for writing UIs, but they are for understanding the Hopscotch framework.

<h3 id="org10a3937"><span class="section-number-3">11.2.</span> The formulaic required repetitive methods of #isMyKind: and #isKindOfX</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-11-2">
<p>
This chapter is jumping right into a piece that is a bit difficult to understand: The required repetitive methods of <code>#isMyKind: other</code> and <code>#isKindOfX</code>.
</p>

<p>
Comments in <code>Fragment</code> and <code>Subject</code> talk about this:
</p>

<p>
<b>Subclasses must implement #isMyKind: which tests whether another instance is of the same kind. The implementation is #isMyKind: is formulaic, calling #isKindOfX for whatever type X the instance represents</b>
</p>

<p>
Because <code>Presenter</code> is a subclass of <code>Fragment</code>, the equivalent of the above statement applies to <code>Presenter</code>.
</p>

<p>
Let us summarize a practical translation of this piece of documentation:
</p>

<p>
<b>Any time we write a concrete implementation of <code>Presenter</code>, <code>Subject</code> or <code>Fragment</code>, we must implement two methods.  Suppose a concrete Presenter class is named <code>MyConcretePresenter</code>.  In this class, we have to implement methods <code>#isMyKind: other</code> and <code>#isKindOfMyConcretePresenter</code> as follows:</b>
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org0df0d54">
isMyKind: other &lt;Fragment&gt; ^ &lt;Boolean&gt; = (
  ^other isKindOfMyConcretePresenter.
)

isKindOfMyConcretePresenter &lt;Boolean&gt; = (
  ^true.
)
</pre>

<p>
Similar code needs to be added to any concrete implementation of <code>Fragment</code> or <code>Subject</code>. Just replace the "Presenter" with "Fragment" or "Subject".
</p>

<p>
In the chapters below, we will not come back to this in too much detail, and always add such methods in our code.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-3-3-1">
<p>
Let us discover, from code browsing, what a concrete implementation of <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#createPresenter</code> should do.
</p>

<p>
From the name and signature, clearly the <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#createPresenter</code> should return a new instance of <code>Presenter</code>. Supposedly this is the actual UI instance.
</p>

<p>
We can get some hints about Presenter implementations in existing Subject extensions from the IDE.  Here is an example of <code>#createPresenter</code> from <code>HomeSubject</code>. All Subject implementations do something equivalent:
</p>

<p>
<code>From class HomeSubject</code>
</p>
<pre class="example" id="orgc30475e">
public createPresenter = (
	^HomePresenter onSubject: self
)
</pre>

<p>
<b>Conclusion: It seems clear that in any concrete implementation of <code>Subject</code> the method  <code>#createPresenter</code> is intended to create and return the Presenter we want to use to present the Subject.</b>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-3-4-1">
<p>
Goal is to discuss how a <code>Presenter</code> instance is created, and where are the Subject &lt;-&gt; Presenter associations created.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8efc4f9" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org8efc4f9"><span class="section-number-5">11.3.4.2.</span> Where is Subject -&gt; Presenter association created? In <b>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</b></h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-3-4-2">
<p>
The exact signature is <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#public presenter ^&lt;Presenter&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>Subject</code> holds association to it's <code>Presenter</code> in the <code>Subject&gt;&gt;presenterSlot</code>. This slot is instantiated lazily in <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code> by calling <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#createPresenter</code>, then storing the instantiated presenter on the <code>presenterSlot</code>:
</p>

<p>
<code>Subject</code>
</p>
<pre class="example" id="orgd10b35a">
public presenter ^&lt;Presenter&gt; = (
  presenterSlot isNil ifTrue: [presenterSlot:: createPresenter].
  presenterSlot generation &lt; uiGeneration ifTrue: [
    presenterSlot:: createPresenter.
    ].
  ^presenterSlot
)
</pre>

<p>
So as long as something calls <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code>, after a Subject is created, then <b>the <code>Subject</code> knows about it's <code>Presenter</code> and keeps in on slot <code>presenterSlot</code>, establishing the Subject-&gt;Presenter association</b> - which is what we wanted to show.
</p>
</div>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-org3712039" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org3712039"><span class="section-number-5">11.3.4.3.</span> Where is Presenter -&gt; Subject association created? In the Presenter primary factory method <b>Presenter&gt;&gt;#class Presenter onSubject: aSubject = Fragment</b></h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-3-4-3">
<p>
The exact signature is public class <code>Presenter onSubject: aSubject &lt;Subject&gt; = Fragment (..)</code>
</p>

<p>
We can find our answer in a few steps, starting with <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code>:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><code>Subject&gt;&gt;#public presenter ^&lt;Presenter&gt;</code> calls <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#public createPresenter ^&lt;Presenter&gt;</code></li>

<li><code>Subject&gt;&gt;#public createPresenter ^&lt;Presenter&gt;</code> creates the Presenter. While this method is abstract, we can discover what it is intended to do:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a) From its signature <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#public createPresenter ^&lt;Presenter&gt;</code></li>
<li><p>
b) By looking as a concrete Presenter implementations in the IDE.  Here is an example of a concrete <code>#createPresenter</code> from <code>HomeSubject</code>
</p>

<p>
<code>From class HomeSubject</code>
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org43bfcc8">
public createPresenter = (
  ^HomePresenter onSubject: self
)
</pre>
<p>
Clearly the conclusion from both is this: The intent of <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#public createPresenter ^&lt;Presenter&gt;</code> is to create a presenter which presents the <code>Subject</code> instance, and return it
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Next, let us study the concrete discovered example of <code>HomePresenter</code>'s primary factory method.
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org1ec6fc7">
class HomePresenter onSubject: s = Presenter onSubject: s (
)
</pre>
<p>
This is a standard Newspeak syntax for a super call. The primary factory method <code>HomePresenter&gt;&gt;#onSubject: subject</code> calls the superclass <code>Presenter&gt;&gt;#onSubject: subject</code> 
</p>

<p>
Having shown that, we can get back to this line:
</p>

<p>
<code>HomePresenter onSubject: self</code> - note that self is subject
</p>

<p>
This will cause the call to the "super" <code>Presenter&gt;&gt;#onSubject: subject</code>. This "super" <code>Presenter&gt;&gt;#onSubject: subject</code> call places the passed subject on slot "subject" in the Presenter's primary factory method:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgc8d4cd4">
public class Presenter onSubject: aSubject &lt;Subject&gt; = Fragment (
  |
  public subject &lt;Subject&gt; ::= aSubject.
  substanceSlot &lt;Fragment&gt;
  public generation &lt;Number&gt; = uiGeneration.
  |)
</pre></li>

<li>So this line <code>public subject &lt;Subject&gt; ::= aSubject</code> creates the association from Presenter -&gt; Subject. The associated subject instance is kept on slot <code>Presenter&gt;&gt;subject</code>.</li>
</ol>


<p>
This is what we have shown in summary: Calling a concrete subject's #presenter such as <code>HomeSubject#presenter</code> will associate Presenter -&gt; Subject.
</p>

<p>
Also, along with the previous chapter, callin <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code> also creates the association "the other way". By calling <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code>, the bidirectional associations Presenter &lt;-&gt; Subject is established.
</p>

<p>
"Some code" must call the <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code> though.

<h4 id="org3e0e436"><span class="section-number-4">11.3.5.</span> Chapter conclusion about principles of writing rudimentary Hopscotch UI</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-3-5">
<p>
In the conclusion of chapter <a href="#org036ad10">Discovery of the <b>HopscotchForHTML5</b> class basics</a> we already discovered an important lifecycle any UI code need to perform: <b>Create an instance of a Model first, a Subject next, a Presenter last</b>.
</p>

<p>
In this chapter <a href="#org5e368c0">The <b>Subject</b> class: primary factory method, instance methods, how Subject knows Presenter</a> we added the following conclusions:
</p>

<p>
<b>Conclusion 1: As long as the <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code> is invoked (on an existing subject instance), two important things happen:</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A <code>Presenter</code> instance is created.</li>
<li>The bidirectional association between the subject and presenter instances is established.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Conclusion 2: So, when creating UIs, our code must invoke the <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code> method, directly, or indirectly by calling some other method that ends up calling <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code>.</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Conclusion 3: Model can be any object.  <code>ConcreteSubject</code> must extend the <code>Subject</code>.  Also the <code>ConcreteSubject</code> primary factory method must declare the primary factory method on the superclass <code>Subject</code> - see <a href="#org7dc9134">The primary factory method <b>public class Subject onModel: aModel = (..)</b></a> ; chapters below come to the equivalent conclusion for <code>ConcretePresenter</code>.</b>
</p>

<p>
Based on the conclusions 1, 2, 3, we can already write some pseudocode for writing core UI:
</p>

<p>
<b>intermediary code - do not use yet</b>
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org4ebfb1a">
|concreteModel concreteSubject concretePresenter|
concreteModel:: ConcreteModel new.
concreteSubject:: ConcreteSubject onModel: concreteModel.
concreteSubject presenter.
</pre>

<p>
Note the last line <code>concreteSubject presenter.</code>: Why did we not use <code>concreteSubject:: ConcretePresenter onSubject: concreteSubject.</code> instead, as seemingly this would achieve the presenter creation anyway?
</p>

<p>
The answer to this question is as follows: While the latter code is certainly possible to use in principle, we have seen in the overview of Subject APIs above, that Hopscotch provides the method <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code> which not only creates the Presenter instance by calling <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#createPresenter</code>, but also wires up the Presenter &lt;-&gt; Subject associations!
</p>

<p>
Clearly, the framework intents application code not to create Presenter instances directly, but intends for application code to call <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code>. However, this call should not be made directly in application code either. In chapter <a href="#orgfdab4af">HopscotchForHTML5: Analyzing senders of <b>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</b> and why <b>HopscotchWindow&gt;&gt;#openSubject: subject</b> should be invoked instead</a> we provided some long reasoning for the following conclusion:
</p>

<p>
<b>Conclusion 4: The root level of an application should not create <code>Presenter</code> directly or by calling <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code> directly. Instead, application should invoke</b>
</p>

<p>
<code>HopscotchWindow&gt;&gt;#openSubject: subject</code>
</p>

<p>
This invocation eventually invokes <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code> as intended, but does additional work of placing the creater <code>Presenter</code> instance in the context of the container body.
</p>

<p>
So we arrived at a summary conclusion.
</p>

<p>
<b>Summary conclusion: Here is the code for a barebones Hopscotch App</b>
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgbbe560f">
|concreteModel concreteSubject concretePresenter|
concreteModel:: ConcreteModel new.
concreteSubject:: ConcreteSubject onModel: concreteModel.
hopscotchWindow openSubject: concreteSubject.
</pre>

<p>
The last line will create instance of ConcretePresenter by calling <code>ConcreteSubject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code> and open it in a new window where the Application will live! This snippet does not show definitions of <code>ConcreteModel</code> <code>ConcreteSubject</code> <code>ConcretePresenter</code>, or how we obtain the <code>hopscotchWindow</code>. We will get to that when creating a concrete Application in <a href="#org9e7d08e">Using Hopscotch discovery a Model-Presenter-Subject Application, the <b>CheckedItemApp</b></a>

<p>
Let us summarize the core classes of Hopscotch: <b>Subject</b> and it's model, <b>Presenter</b> and <b>Fragment</b> described in chapters above.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
<code>Subject</code>: can be thought of as "address + viewport"; is passed to NavigationHistory; instantiates it's Presenter;
</p>

<p>
See <a href="#org5e368c0">The <b>Subject</b> class: primary factory method, instance methods, how Subject knows Presenter</a>
</p></li>

<li><p>
<code>Presenter</code>: presents domain objects; is part of hierarchical structure of presenters; instantiates and controls Widgets (Fragments); once instantiated, is the UI presentation of it's Subject;
</p>

<p>
See <a href="#org3a65521">The <b>Presenter</b> class: primary factory method, instance methods, how Presenter knows Subject</a>
</p></li>

<li>Important methods:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code> - calls <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#createPresenter</code> then <b>associates Subject -&gt; Presenter</b>. See <a href="#org8efc4f9">Where is Subject -&gt; Presenter association created? In <b>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</b></a></li>
<li><code>Subject&gt;&gt;#createPresenter</code> creates and returns the presenter instance by calling the concrete Presenter's primary factory method. See <a href="#org0a5d548">The unimplemented (abstract) methods: <b>Subject&gt;&gt;#createPresenter</b> and <b>Subject&gt;&gt;#isMyKind: otherSubject</b></a></li>
<li><code>Presenter&gt;&gt;#definition</code> creates the Fragment the presenter uses to present itself (view). See <a href="#org05280bc">The unimplemented (abstract) methods: <b>Presenter&gt;&gt;#definition</b> and <b>Presenter&gt;&gt;#isMyKind: fragment</b></a></li>
<li><code>class Subject&gt;&gt;#onModel: aModel</code> - <b>primary factory method associates Subject -&gt; Model</b>. See <a href="#org7dc9134">The primary factory method <b>public class Subject onModel: aModel = (..)</b></a></li>
<li><code>class Presenter&gt;&gt;#onSubject: selfSubject</code> - <b>primary factory method associates Presenter -&gt; Subject</b>. See <a href="#org1807bb7">The primary factory method <b>class Presenter onSubject: aSubject = Fragment (..)</b></a></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>
We established that associations between <code>*Subject* and it's model, *Presenter* and *Fragment*</code> are as follows:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Presenter -&gt; Subject -&gt; Model</b></li>
<li><b>Presenter &lt;- Subject &lt;-w Model</b> (-&gt; and &lt;- means association, &lt;-w means weak association- may not exist in some implementations)</li>
<li>Both directions in the <b>Presenter &lt;-&gt; Subject</b> association are established by calling the <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code> method</li>
<li>The <b>Subject -&gt; Model</b> association is established in the Subject primary factory method <code>Subject class&gt;&gt;#onModel: aModel</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
See <a href="#org8efc4f9">Where is Subject -&gt; Presenter association created? In <b>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</b></a> and <a href="#org3712039">Where is Presenter -&gt; Subject association created? In the Presenter primary factory method <b>Presenter&gt;&gt;#class Presenter onSubject: aSubject = Fragment</b></a>
</p></li>

<li>Lifecycle discoveries: We need to create a model first, a subject next, a presenter last. See <a href="#org3e0e436">Chapter conclusion about principles of writing rudimentary Hopscotch UI</a> for many details and also  <a href="#org036ad10">Discovery of the <b>HopscotchForHTML5</b> class basics</a></li>

<li>Presenter should not be constructed in code directly using it's primary factory method. It should be constructed indirectly as <code>hopscotchWindow openSubject: concreteSubject.</code>. See <a href="#org3e0e436">Chapter conclusion about principles of writing rudimentary Hopscotch UI</a>.</li>

<li>To implement some concrete UI, developer should:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>implement classes for <code>ConcreteModel</code>,  <code>ConcreteSubject</code>, and <code>ConcretePresenter</code></li>
<li>All abstract methods in the above classes must be implemented. In particular, code methods to implement are
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>ConcreteSubject&gt;&gt;#createPresenter</code> which should create and return presenter for the subject. This should return typically, <code>ConcretePresenter onSubject: self</code></li>
<li><code>ConcretePresenter&gt;&gt;#define</code> which should create and return the Fragment (Presenter). This is a widget or multiple widgets layed out (e.g. row with a checkbox, label, and an icon)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Write rudimentary code in <a href="#org3e0e436">Chapter conclusion about principles of writing rudimentary Hopscotch UI</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>


<p>
The above steps should be sufficient to write a basic Application with Hopscotch UI, which we will do in later chapter <a href="#org9e7d08e">Using Hopscotch discovery a Model-Presenter-Subject Application, the <b>CheckedItemApp</b></a>.

<p>
Looking at the top level, we see two related classes, <code>HopscotchForHTML5</code> and <code>HopscotchForHTML5Runtime</code>. So what is the latter class good for?
</p>
</div>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-org57f6b45" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org57f6b45"><span class="section-number-4">11.7.2.</span> The <b>HopscotchForHTML5</b> class</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-7-2">
<p>
Let us get back for a minute to <code>HopscotchForHTML5</code>. We have seen, that is has a ton of slots and classes we would associate with UI elements, such as
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org3769919">
(* primary factory method *)
class HopscotchForHTML5 usingPlatform: p images: images ducts: ds = (
  |
  (* Imports *)
  private Color = p graphics Color.
  private Context = p graphics Context.
  private Holder = ds Holder.
  private Font = p fonts Font.
  .. etc ..
  public styleZebraPrimaryColor = Color white.
  public styleZebraSecondaryColor = Color gray: 0.97.
  |)
</pre>

<pre class="example" id="orgdd2d290">
(* Selected nested classes *)
class ButtonFragment
class DatePickerFragment
.. etc ..
class Subject
class Presented
class Fragment
.. etc ..
</pre>

<p>
We alreary concluded that we will need an instance of <code>HopscotchForHTML5</code> if we want to build any UI for our Apps.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org773a03b" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org773a03b"><span class="section-number-4">11.7.3.</span> The <b>HopscotchForHTML5Runtime</b> class</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-7-3">
<p>
Analyzing the class <code>HopscotchForHTML5Runtime</code>, we see that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It has the primary factory method <code>#packageUsing: manifest</code>. From the Api chapters, for example  <a href="#org2852d73">4. Application module: API of module that needs to be distributed as an App</a> we know that such top level classes are apps, but, lacking the <code>#main: platform args: args</code> method, such module is used as library module.</li>

<li>It packages the UI class, <code>HopscotchForHTML5</code>, on it's slot</li>

<li>It has a instance method <code>#using: platform</code>, which calls the primary factory method of <code>PlatformWithHopscotch</code> and returns it's instance.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<code>HopscotchForHTML5Runtime</code>
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org5f3c99e">
(* primary factory method *)
class HopscotchForHTML5Runtime packageUsing: manifest = (
	|
	private Fonts = manifest FontsForHTML5.
  private Graphics = manifest GraphicsForHTML5.
	private TextModule = manifest TextModule.
	private Hopscotch = manifest HopscotchForHTML5.
  private Ducts = manifest Ducts.
	private images = Images packageUsing: manifest.
	|
)

(* instance method *)
public using: platform = (
	^PlatformWithHopscotch usingPlatform: platform
)
</pre>

<p>
The presence of the two methods clearly shows  <code>HopscotchForHTML5Runtime</code> packages all three classes (HopscotchForHTML5, Ducts, images) that we will need to create <code>HopscotchForHTML5</code> using its primary factory method <code>HopscotchForHTML5&gt;&gt;#usingPlatform: p images: images ducts: ds</code>.
</p>

<p>
<b>So, the HopscotchForHTML5Runtime packages everything we need for HopscotchForHTML5</b>
</p>

<p>
In addition, we see that the inner class <code>HopscotchForHTML5Runtime&gt;&gt;PlatformWithHopscotch</code> is a convenience class which already pre-creates instance of <code>HopscotchForHTML5</code> in this <code>PlatformWithHopscotch</code> snippet:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orga36e298">
(* primary factory method *)
class PlatformWithHopscotch usingPlatform: platform = (
	|
    public isKindOfPlatformWithElectron = platform isKindOfPlatformWithElectron.	
    public kernel = platform kernel.
    public collections = platform collections.
    public actors = platform actors.
    public mirrors = platform mirrors.    
    public js = platform js.
    public operatingSystem = platform operatingSystem.
    public fonts = Fonts usingPlatform: self.
    public graphics = Graphics usingPlatform: self.
    public text = TextModule usingPlatform: self.
    public hopscotch = Hopscotch usingPlatform: self images: images ducts: (Ducts usingPlatform: self).
    public local = platform.
    public victoryFuel = platform operatingSystem = 'emscripten' ifTrue: [platform victoryFuel].
	|
)
</pre>

<p>
<b>A core question: what object is in the slot <code>hopscotch</code> in the above factory?</b> Let's follow these points:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
<code>HopscotchForHTML5Runtime</code>, the outer class of <code>PlatformWithHopscotch</code> creates this slot:
</p>

<p>
<code>private Hopscotch = manifest HopscotchForHTML5.</code>
</p>

<p>
clearly, the <code>Hopscotch</code> slot on <code>HopscotchForHTML5Runtime</code> holds the class <code>HopscotchForHTML5</code>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Next we see this line in the <code>PlatformWithHopscotch</code> primary factory method above - the <code>class PlatformWithHopscotch usingPlatform: platform</code>:
</p>

<p>
<code>public hopscotch = Hopscotch usingPlatform: self images: images ducts: (Ducts usingPlatform: self)</code>
</p>

<p>
uses the expression <code>Hopscotch</code>. What does it refer to?? In Newspeak, an expression like this used in a primary factory method slot, must be somewhere in the scope of the primary factory method's scope! The only items in scope there, must be in a slot of a parent class! Parent class of <code>PlatformWithHopscotch</code> is <code>HopscotchForHTML5Runtime</code>. So this <code>Hopscotch</code> we are talking about here refers to a <code>Hopscotch</code> slot in <code>HopscotchForHTML5Runtime</code>. And we have seen in item 1, that it holds the class <code>HopscotchForHTML5</code>. As a result, the primary factory method in
</p>

<p>
<code>public hopscotch = Hopscotch usingPlatform: self images: images ducts: (Ducts usingPlatform: self)</code>
</p>

<p>
is the same as
</p>

<p>
<code>public hopscotch = HopscotchForHTML5 usingPlatform: self images: images ducts: (Ducts usingPlatform: self)</code>
</p></li>
</ol>



<p>
From there we have the answer to our core question of this paragraph: <b>The slot <code>hopscotch</code> in the factory for PlatformWithHopscotch is instance of <code>HopscotchForHTML5</code></b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Now let's draw two conclusions we arrived at in this paragraph:</b>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Conclusion 1. The module HopscotchForHTML5Runtime is a packaging library for instances of HopscotchForHTML5. By packaging the runtime, everything we need to write UI code is available in the HopscotchForHTML5 instance. How do we get such instance? This is described in Conclusion 2.</b></li>

<li><p>
<b>Conclusion 2. Any code that is able to create <code>hopscotchForHTML5Runtime</code>, an instance of <code>HopscotchForHTML5Runtime</code> will have access to instance of <code>HopscotchForHTML5</code> using the second line below:</b>
</p>

<p>
<code>hopscotchForHTML5Runtime using: platform.</code> &lt;== this is instance of PlatformWithHopscotch
<code>(hopscotchForHTML5Runtime using: platform) hopscotch.</code> &lt;== hopscotch is the slot on PlatformWithHopscotch. It is instance of HopscotchForHTML5 as we have seen above.
</p></li>
</ol>


<p>
Summary: In this chapter, we deduced code we need to obtain <code>hopscotch</code>, an instance of <code>HopscotchForHTML5</code>. This instance is all we need to write any Newspeak UI!

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-8-1">
<p>
This chapter uses Hopscotch knowledge acquired in the above chapters, to develop a sample UI Application in Newspeak. 
</p>

<p>
As with other Applications with UI, we will need two top level classes. Let us name the Application class <code>CheckedItemApp</code> and it's UI class <code>CheckedItemUI</code>.  The basic structure of an Application with UI was already described on several examples, including <a href="#orgff12272">Code, run, and debug the CounterApp in Newspeak</a> .
</p>

<p>
The knowledge about a structure of a UI class, the Model-Presenter-Subject was developed by browsing the <code>HopscotchForHTML5</code> in <a href="#org036ad10">Discovery of the <b>HopscotchForHTML5</b> class basics</a>, and is used below in <a href="#org98b1733">3. Write code for <b>CheckedItemUI</b>, the class showing the UI</a>.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org5b0f206" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5b0f206"><span class="section-number-4">11.8.2.</span> 1. Start coding the Application class <b>CheckedItemApp</b></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-8-2">
<p>
We will use information about APIs that define a Newspeak Application from chapter <a href="#org2852d73">4. Application module: API of module that needs to be distributed as an App</a>  and <a href="#org9a7e285">3. Hello World from Application</a> to create the application class <code>CheckedItemApp</code>.
</p>

<p>
First, we create the class for a top level Application module.  We can create this class in the IDE, or create the class in a text file, then <a href="#org519fcbe">"Compile file(s)"</a>.  We start with a text file.
</p>

<p>
Regarding the methods the <code>CheckedItemApp</code> class should have, there should be a primary factory <code>#packageUsing: manifest</code> and an instance method <code>#main: platform args: args</code>. This makes the class a packageble, distributable, and runnable Newspeak app (an Application module).  See <a href="#org8b9fb6e">Newspeak modules API zoo</a> for Newspeak "convention methods" signatures.
</p>


<p>
<code>class CheckedItemApp</code>
</p>
<pre class="example" id="orgf8c7833">
class CheckedItemApp packageUsing: manifest = ()
(
  public main: platform args: args = (
    'Hello World from HelloWorldApp' out.

<h4 id="org98b1733"><span class="section-number-4">11.8.3.</span> 3. Write code for <b>CheckedItemUI</b>, the class showing the UI</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-8-3">
<p>
Chapter introduction and goal: In this chapter, we will write  <code>CheckedItemUI</code>, the UI of the application.  The UI code will be spread over several nested classes of the top level class <code>CheckedItemUI</code>.  To write this UI, we will use the knowledge discovered and summarized in chapter <a href="#orgcef8185">Summary of <b>Subject</b> and it's model, <b>Presenter</b> and <b>Fragment</b>, their associations, and their lifecycle</a>.   We will need to create concrete nested classes for the <b>Model, Subject and Presenter</b>, then we will need to instantiate those classes (in that order) to form the UI.
</p>

<p>
The UI will be extremely simple: a label with text "check this", and one check box. We should be able to check the checkbox. That is all.
</p>

<p>
Note that we will not write any <b>Fragment</b> (Widget) classes, we only use some preexisting fragment-creation methods discovered by browsing <code>HopscotchForHTLM5&gt;&gt;Presenter</code> such as <code>#row:</code>, <code>#label:</code> and <code>#checkbox:</code>.
</p>

<p>
Chapters below describe writing the code for <b>CheckedItemUI</b> step by step.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf3b08f1" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="orgf3b08f1"><span class="section-number-5">11.8.3.1.</span> Class CheckedItemUI</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-8-3-1">
<p>
Let's add a new top level class <code>CheckedItemUI</code>.
</p>

<p>
We plan for the new top level class <code>CheckedItemUI</code> to contain:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Slots needed to create elements in the instance of this class.</li>

<li>Nested classes <code>CheckedItemModel</code>, <code>CheckedItemSubject</code> and <code>CheckedItemPresenter</code> which we will create below. Important: Notice that these classes are nested in the top level class (module) <code>CheckedItemUI</code>.  This is a natural modularization we would use in Newspeak; so the classes' naming prefix <code>CheckedItem</code> in <code>CheckedItemModel</code> and other nested classes introduced in this chapter is not needed. We will keep the class names prefix for the purpose of clarity of the text.  Also notice this nesting mimics the nesting of <code>Subject</code> and <code>Presenter</code> in the module <code>HopscotchForHTML5</code>.</li>
</ol>


<p>
We can start only with the barenones of our UI, like this:
</p>

<p>
<code>class CheckedItemUI</code>
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org5b33e06">
class CheckedItemUI = () ()
</pre>

<p>
We will add it's primary factory method, slots, and it's nested classes along the way in later chapters.  In particular we will add:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The nested classes will be added naturally by adding them inside <code>CheckedItemUI</code> in the IDE. This happens in chapters <a href="#orgb097b1d">Class CheckedItemModel</a>,  <a href="#orga4c4045">Class CheckedItemSubject</a>,  and <a href="#orgec9707a">Class CheckedItemPresenter</a> .</li>

<li>The primary factory method and slots will be added once we finish the rest of the app code and the UI code - in chapter <a href="#org9a8c03f">When the app runs in the <b>#main:args:</b> method, instantiate the <b>CheckedItemUI</b></a> and its subchapters.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgb097b1d" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="orgb097b1d"><span class="section-number-5">11.8.3.2.</span> Class CheckedItemModel</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-8-3-2">
<p>
As discussed in <a href="#orgcef8185">Summary of <b>Subject</b> and it's model, <b>Presenter</b> and <b>Fragment</b>, their associations, and their lifecycle</a>, we start writing UI with writing the model class. As this is a part of the UI, a natural way to express such composition is to make the model class <b>a nested class in <code>CheckedItemUI</code>.</b>
</p>

<p>
Let's name the model class <code>CheckedItemModel</code>.
</p>

<p>
To support the UI, we need two slots in our model: a string for the <code>itemText</code>, and a Boolean <code>isChecked</code>, representing if the checkbox was selected. We also add a third slot <code>itemTextWithStatus</code> for tracking the <code>isChecked</code> as text.  Our model class extends Object by default; it's primary factory method is the default <code>#new</code> method. Neither the default parent class Object nor the default primary factory method <code>#new</code> need to be specified in Newspeak. 
</p>

<p>
<code>class CheckedItemModel</code>
</p>
<pre class="example" id="orgec66c98">
public class CheckedItemModel = (
|
  public itemText = 'Not Editable Todo itemText: '.
  public itemTextWithStatus ::= itemText, ' : STILL TODO'.
  public isChecked ::= false.
  |
) (
)
</pre>
</div>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-orga4c4045" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="orga4c4045"><span class="section-number-5">11.8.3.3.</span> Class CheckedItemSubject</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-8-3-3">
<p>
Having defined a model class <code>CheckedItemModel</code>, we need to define our UI's concrete Subject class, let's name it <code>CheckedItemSubject</code>. Naturally, it will be an extension of Subject. As mentioned, it will be nested in <code>CheckedItemUI</code>.
</p>

<p>
Recall from <a href="#org5e368c0">The <b>Subject</b> class: primary factory method, instance methods, how Subject knows Presenter</a> that the primary factory method of Subject is <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#onModel: model</code>. This will associate subject with it's model.  We will use the same name for the primary factory method for our <code>CheckedItemSubject</code> and call the super factory from Subject.
</p>

<p>
We will also use the knowledge from the same chapter regarding it's primary factory method and abstract methods we need to implement. Let us summarize it here again: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The primary factory method of our <code>CheckedItemSubject</code> will call the primary factory method of it's parent, <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#onModel: model</code>.  This is expressed by the signature <code>public class CheckedItemSubject onModel: model = Subject onModel: model</code> where our new class calls the super primary factory <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#onModel: model</code>.</li>

<li><code>Subject</code> class has an abstract method <code>#createPresenter</code> (indicated by "subclassResponsibility") which should return a presenter. In the same link, we saw that <code>#createPresenter</code> should create an instance of Presenter (the yet-to-be-created <code>CheckedItemPresenter</code>). The instance should then be returned.</li>

<li>We need to add the formulaic implementations of <code>#isMyKind</code> and <code>#isKindOfCheckedItemSubject</code>. See <a href="#org10a3937">The formulaic required repetitive methods of #isMyKind: and #isKindOfX</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So the code for our concrete Subject <code>CheckedItemSubject</code> which implements the desired primary factory method and all abstract methods implemented should be:
</p>

<p>
<code>class CheckedItemSubject</code>
</p>
<pre class="example" id="orgfd50b0f">
public class CheckedItemSubject onModel: model = Subject onModel: model (
) (
(* Important override: Creates Presenter. Called by the framework in openSubject called
   from ~CheckedItemApp&gt;&gt;#main:args:~ when calling ~HopscotchWindow openSubject: checkedItemSubject.~
   Framework also associates Subject -&gt; Presenter via Subject&gt;&gt;#presenterSlot:: ^createPresenter
*)
createPresenter = (
    ^CheckedItemPresenter onSubject: self.
  )
(* required isMyKind and isKindOfX formulaic methods *)
isMyKind: other = (
    ^ other isKindOfCheckedItemSubject.
  )
isKindOfCheckedItemSubject = (
    ^ true.
  )
)
</pre>
</div>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-orgec9707a" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="orgec9707a"><span class="section-number-5">11.8.3.4.</span> Class CheckedItemPresenter</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-8-3-4">
<p>
Having defined a model class <code>CheckedItemModel</code> and a subject class <code>CheckedItemSubject</code>, we will need the last piece of our UI, the concrete Presenter class.
</p>

<p>
Presenter is the class which does the work of creating the UI widgets. We have seen in chapter <a href="#org3a65521">The <b>Presenter</b> class: primary factory method, instance methods, how Presenter knows Subject</a> that Presenter is created in the primary factory method <code>Presenter&gt;&gt;#onSubject: subject</code>, and it contains important wiring of the subject and presenter associations. Our concrete class primary factory method must do the same, so it needs to call this parent factory. This is done using <i>primary primary factory method</i> <code>CheckedItemPresenter onSubject: subject = Presenter onSubject: subject ()</code>  
</p>

<p>
For a concrete UI, method which creates the UI view is <code>#definition</code>. It does that by creating and returning Fragmets or Presenter objects. The created objects can be a composition of both layout elements such as rows and columns, and widgets such as checkboxes and labels.
</p>

<p>
Also, we will need <a href="#org10a3937">The formulaic required repetitive methods of #isMyKind: and #isKindOfX</a>.
</p>

<p>
As with the model and subject, we make the <code>CheckedItemPresenter</code> an inner class of <code>CheckedItemUI</code>, by clicking the + beside Classes inside CheckedItemUI.
</p>


<p>
<code>class CheckedItemPresenter</code>
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org3b47212">
public class CheckedItemPresenter onSubject: subject = Presenter onSubject: subject (
) (
public definition = (

    ^column: {
      (* Note: #label: and #checkbox:value:action: are methods on presenter *)
      label: 'Rudimentary TODO App'.
      checkbox: subject model itemTextWithStatus
      value: subject model isChecked
      action: [  :aaachecked | updateGUI:
                           [  (subject model isChecked)
                                  ifTrue: [
                                    subject model isChecked: false.
                                    subject model itemTextWithStatus: subject model itemText, ' : STILL TODO'.
                                    ]
                                  ifFalse: [
                                    subject model isChecked: true.
                                    subject model itemTextWithStatus: subject model itemText, ' : DONE'.
                                  ]
                            ]
                        ]
      .
    }. 
  )

  isMyKind: other = (
    ^other isKindOfCheckedItemPresenter.
  )

  isKindOfCheckedItemPresenter = (
    ^true.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-8-4">
<p>
So far we have prepared two separate classes:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><code>CheckedItemApp</code>: We created this class as a (so far almost empty) top level class in <a href="#org5b0f206">1. Start coding the Application class <b>CheckedItemApp</b></a>. We equipped the class with API methods that make the class instance an application.</li>
<li><code>CheckedItemUI</code>: We added this class in step <a href="#org98b1733">3. Write code for <b>CheckedItemUI</b>, the class showing the UI</a>. In that step, we also added the code that creates a row of widgets (fragments) in the <code>CheckedItemUI&gt;&gt;#define</code> method.</li>
</ol>


<p>
In the rest of this chapter, we finish integrating the <code>CheckedItemUI</code> into the <code>CheckedItemApp</code> by creating an instance of <code>CheckedItemUI</code> in the main method of the <code>CheckedItemApp</code>.  This instance creation will perform the process of showing our UI, defined in the <code>CheckedItemUI&gt;&gt;#define</code> method.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0238671" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org0238671"><span class="section-number-5">11.8.4.1.</span> Package the <b>CheckedItemUI</b> class into the <b>CheckedItemApp</b></h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-8-4-1">
<p>
As we know, Newspeak must explicitly package all dependencies that may not exist on the target system where we deploy our <code>CheckedItemApp</code> app.
</p>

<p>
The packaging is done inside the IDE in "convention method" named <code>CheckedItemApp&gt;&gt;#packageUsing: manifest</code>.
</p>

<p>
The code changes we need to make to achieve the dependency packaging is marked here:
</p>

<p>
<code>class CheckedItemApp</code>
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org94af255">
class CheckedItemApp packageUsing: manifest = (
  |
  (* Added 1-line to package the CheckedItemUI class on slot with same name *)
  CheckedItemUI = manifest CheckedItemUI.
  |
)
</pre>

<p>
The <code>CheckedItemUI</code> class is pulled (from manifest) and stored on a slot named <code>CheckedItemUI</code> (this is customary, to name the slot same as the class name, but does not have to be). This is similar to importing the class <code>CheckedItemUI</code> into <code>CheckedItemApp</code> in other languages.
</p>

<p>
However, packaging in Newspeak performed by placing some object or class on slot does more.  Apart from declaring the dependency of <code>CheckedItemApp</code> on <code>CheckedItemUI</code>, the actual CODE for the class <code>CheckedItemUI</code> will be serialized and shipped with the <code>CheckedItemApp</code>, when it is serialized as <code>CheckedItemApp.vfuel</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9a8c03f" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org9a8c03f"><span class="section-number-5">11.8.4.2.</span> When the app runs in the <b>#main:args:</b> method, instantiate the <b>CheckedItemUI</b></h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-11-8-4-2">
<p>
When the <code>CheckedItemApp</code> starts (which we know is in the <code>#main:args</code> method), we need to create an instance of <code>CheckedItemUI</code>. Once we have the instance, we need to create instances of the nested model, then subject, then presenter. 
</p>

<p>
In the summary conclusion in <a href="#org3e0e436">Chapter conclusion about principles of writing rudimentary Hopscotch UI</a> we have summarized how a rudimentary Hopscotch UI should be created. Let us repeat it here:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org585687d">
|concreteModel concreteSubject concretePresenter|
concreteModel:: ConcreteModel new.
concreteSubject:: ConcreteSubject onModel: concreteModel.
hopscotchWindow openSubject: concreteSubject.
</pre>

<p>
So let us expand this snippet to the full UI code that will run when the app starts.  Instead of the above snippet names starting with <i>Concrete</i> start them with <i>CheckedItem</i>.

<h6 id="org42efb53"><span class="section-number-6">11.8.4.2.1.</span> Why did we add, in CheckedItemApp, the line calling primary factory method of CheckedItemUI?</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-11-8-4-2-1">
<p>
So, why did we add this line to the <code>CheckedItemApp&gt;&gt;#main:args:</code> method:
</p>

<p>
<code>checkedItemUI = CheckedItemUI usingPlatform: platform.</code>?
</p>

<p>
Explanation:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Application module <code>CheckedItemApp</code> is merely a (packagable) wrapper around the general module <code>CheckedItemUI</code>. The <code>CheckedItemUI</code> needs a <i>primary factory method</i> such as  <code>CheckedItemUI&gt;&gt;#usingPlatform: platform.</code>  which is passed a platform object.  At runtime, during their instantiation, instances of top level classes "import" dependencies from the <code>platform</code>.  All top level classes that are general modules need such <i>primary factory method</i>. It was discussed at length in the early sections, around and after section <a href="#org9ad5139">Application and library modules in Newspeak</a> and summarized in <a href="#org8b9fb6e">Newspeak modules API zoo</a>. This is what the added line expresses: It creates an instance of CheckedItemUI and stores it on a local variable.</li>

<li>Looking back to chapter <a href="#orgf3b08f1">Class CheckedItemUI</a>, we did not add any slots or constructors for the top level class <code>CheckedItemUI</code> so far.  Our <code>CheckedItemUI</code> will definitely need to "import" and "hold on" classes or instances of <code>Subject</code> and <code>Presenter</code> for use in it's nested classes <code>CheckedItemSubject</code> and <code>CheckedItemPresenter</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This explanation also leads to the need to beef up the module <code>CheckedItemUI</code> by adding both a <i>primary factory method</i> and <i>slots</i> for classes needed by nested children.
</p>

<p>
So as discussed in the explanation, let's add the <i>primary factory method</i> and it's slots to <code>CheckedItemUI</code>.
</p>

<p>
Replace the <code>CheckedItemUI&gt;&gt;#new</code> constructor with the following:
</p>

<p>
<code>class CheckedItemUI</code>
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org233a9c1">
class CheckedItemUI usingPlatform: platform = (
(* Added this primary factory method and slots for Subject and Presenter *)
|
Subject   = platform hopscotch Subject.
Presenter = platform hopscotch Presenter.
|
)
</pre>

<p>
<code>platform hopscotch</code> returns instance of HopscotchForHTML5 which has access to the <code>HopscotchForHTML5&gt;&gt;#Subject</code> and <code>HopscotchForHTML5&gt;&gt;#Presenter</code> nested classes (among others).  The added code above just stores them on slots of <code>CheckedItemUI</code> with same names.
</p>

<p>
To recap, the classes stored on slots <code>Subject</code> and <code>Presenter</code> are needed in the <code>CheckedItemUI</code> for use by its nested classes, the <code>CheckedItemPresenter</code> and  <code>CheckedItemSubject</code>.  When the nested classes refer to <code>Subject</code> and <code>Presenter</code> in their code - for example in the constructor line <code>CheckedItemSubject onModel: model = Subject onModel:</code> - the <code>Subject</code> can only be found if it is on a slot of either the CheckedItemSubject or the owner CheckedItemUI. <b>As always in Newspeak, all dependencies must be found somewhere in the slot scope going up</b>.
</p>

<p>
A note: The need to put <code>Subject</code> on slot of <code>CheckedItemUI</code> rather than (for example) on the <code>CheckedItemSubject</code> is due to the fact that any element used in the constructor of <code>CheckedItemSubject</code> must be available in the scope of slots in nesting classes all the way up, when the contructor is called.
</p>

<p>
In summary, as the <code>CheckedItemApp&gt;&gt;#main:args:</code> is called, it should:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>instantiate the class on it's slot <code>CheckedItemUI</code> and store instance on local slot <code>checkedItemUI</code></li>
<li>declare some local variables checkedItemModel/Subject/Presenter for their instances</li>
<li>create model instance using   <code>checkedItemModel:: checkedItemUI CheckedItemModel new</code>. Note how inner class <code>CheckedItemModel</code> is referred to from instance <code>checkedItemUI</code></li>
<li>create subject instance using <code>checkedItemSubject:: checkedItemUI CheckedItemSubject onModel: checkedItemModel</code>.</li>
<li>open hopsotch window on the subject using <code>platform hopscotch HopscotchWindow openSubject: checkedItemSubject</code>.</li>
<li>See <a href="#orge9742c1">12.1</a> on how Presented is instantiated and Subject -&gt; Presenter associated</li>
</ul>


<p>
The local variable <code>checkedItemUI</code> will be used to create and show the UI in the code detailed in the next chapter.

This is the last step we need to discuss!
</p>

<p>
The last three lines below create the rudimentary Hopscotch UI with a window, and an instance of <code>CheckedItemPresenter</code> placed in the window. For details, see <a href="#org9a8c03f">When the app runs in the <b>#main:args:</b> method, instantiate the <b>CheckedItemUI</b></a> and in detail in <a href="#org3e0e436">Chapter conclusion about principles of writing rudimentary Hopscotch UI</a>.

Note: The code for the <b>CheckedItemApp</b> built here is as simple as it can be, to focus on understanding <code>HopscotchForHTML5</code>. The Application should be improved in the future. The main weakness of the current version is that it exposes model publicly - model should be private wrapped in Subject.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-1">
<p>
Motivation: We know that <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code> is a crucial method that creates a presenter for an existing subject, and establishes their association. We want to find the method or methods applications should invoke that eventually lead to calling <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code>.
</p>


<p>
We know <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code> invokes <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#createPresenter</code>. This seems a good indication that the Hopscotch framework creators wanted us to invoke <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code> to get us from a Subject instance to a Presenter instance (the one created in <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#createPresenter</code>); the Presenter instantiated there would then present the UI. (We already discussed that it is reasonable to assume that implementations of <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#createPresenter</code> should create and return a concrete Presenter.)
</p>

<p>
But do we know whether:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>We are supposed to invoke <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code> directly in our application?</li>

<li>Or is the intent of Hopscotch that our application should invoke some other method and through several steps inside the Hopscotsch framework eventually call <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code>?</li>
</ol>

<p>
Well that is a good detective story. Let us take a wild assumption that item 2 is the intended method.
</p>

<p>
There is a vague weak supporting reason for possibility 2. An Application will have to create something like a Window, a Frame, or some such object into which our app will be presented. So maybe, a good place to look for a method our application should invoke (instead of <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code>, is some kind of Window creation in HopscotchForHTML5 (where we would expect <code>Subject#presenter</code> to be invoked).
</p>

<p>
Let us investigate that direction.
</p>

<p>
A) First, let's look for senders of <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code>, all the way up.  There are only four senders of <code>#presenter</code> in Hopscotch classes:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><code>#enterSubject:</code> in Subject in HopscotchForHTML5</li>
<li><code>#enterSubject:</code> in HopscotchShell in HopscotchForHTML5</li>
<li><code>#refresh</code> in HopscotchShell in HopscotchForHTML5</li>
<li><code>#refreshmentPresenter</code> in Presenter in HopscotchForHTML5</li>
</ol>

<p>
The first just calls the second
</p>

<p>
<code>class Subject</code>
</p>
<pre class="example" id="orgd0b532a">
enterSubject: s = (
	(* TODO: use sendUp and open a new window if undelivered *)
	^shell enterSubject: s
)
</pre>
<p>
We can ignore the third and forth, as they have to do with refresh. That leaves us with the second, <code>HopscotchShell&gt;&gt;enterSubject:</code>. If we find who sends this message, (maybe following up a few of its senders) we should arrive at the method our application should invoke (which then would end up calling #createSubject, the method we are intrested in calling. 
</p>

<p>
B) So next, let's look for senders of <code>HopscotchShell&gt;&gt;#enterSubject: subject</code> only in Hopscotch classes, we get
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>enterSubject: in ToolbarPresenter in HopscotchWindow in HopscotchForHTML5</li>
<li>enterSubject: in Presenter in HopscotchForHTML5</li>
<li>enterSubject:fromSnippet: in EmbeddedHopscotchWindow in HopscotchForHTML5</li>
<li>find: in ToolbarPresenter in IDEWindow in Browsing</li>
<li>goHome in HopscotchShell in HopscotchForHTML5</li>
<li>homeButton in Presenter in HopscotchForHTML5</li>
<li><code>into:openSubject: in HopscotchWindow in HopscotchForHTML5</code></li>
<li>openSubject: in Window in HopscotchProxy in AppPlatform in Browsing</li>
</ol>

<p>
Now a detective story becomes more of a guessing game. But anything that is creating a Window or invoked from Window is a good guess, as any application would have to place it's Presenter into a Window or Frame or some such.
</p>

<p>
So let's look further at 7.
</p>

<p>
<code>HopscotchWindow&gt;&gt;#into: container openSubject: subject</code>
</p>

<p>
This seems to be doing something useful, it creates a toolbar, adds it to container, etc.
</p>

<p>
C) So let's look for senders of <code>HopscotchWindow&gt;&gt;#into:openSubject:</code> only in Hopscotch classes, we get
</p>


<ol class="org-ol">
<li>into:openSubject: in EmbeddedHopscotchWindow in HopscotchForHTML5</li>
<li>openSubject: in EmbeddedHopscotchWindow in HopscotchForHTML5</li>
<li>openSubject: in HopscotchWindow in HopscotchForHTML5</li>
</ol>


<p>
<code>HopscotchWindow&gt;&gt;#openSubject: subject</code>
</p>

<p>
public openSubject: s = (
	^into: body openSubject: s
)
</p>

<p>
is promising.
</p>

<p>
<code>HopscotchWindow&gt;&gt;#openSubject: subject</code> looks like may be the method that we should invoke in our app to eventually create the Presenter.
</p>

<p>
The invocations sequence would be <a id="orge9742c1"></a>
</p>

<p>
<code>HopscotchWindow&gt;&gt;#openSubject: subject</code> invokes -&gt;
<code>HopscotchWindow&gt;&gt;#into: container openSubject: subject</code>  invokes -&gt;
<code>HopscotchShell&gt;&gt;#enterSubject: subject</code>   invokes -&gt;
<code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code> invokes -&gt;
<code>Subject&gt;&gt;#createPresenter</code>
</p>

<p>
The last method creates and returns the presenter; which is then entered and placed to the page container (body).
</p>

<p>
<b>Conclusion: We found through some assumption, a bit of detective work through code that included guesses, that our application should not create <code>Presenter</code> directly or by calling <code>Subject&gt;&gt;#presenter</code> directly. Instead, our application should invoke</b>
</p>


<p>
<code>HopscotchWindow&gt;&gt;#openSubject: subject</code>
</p>

<p>
<b>this invocation will do the work of creating the Presenter for the Subject, and entering the presenter into the appropriate place in the container body.</b>
</p>

<p>
We will use this conclusion as a core conclusion when writing our sample Application.

<li>Reactivity: Hudak's book The Haskell School of Expression</li>

<li>What is "Hopscotch's component model* Gilad mentions as reactivity he added?</li>

<li>change begin_example to begin_src??  - when the block is named such as <code>MyClass</code>, add ".ns" to class, <code>MyClass.ns</code></li>

<li>clarify - throughout the document, we should clarify that 'deploy' means 'create deployable artifact' - a file that can be deployed!! Also go over all text talking about 'deploy'</li>

<li>Look for "Module type", and come up with a <i>term for it</i> - maybe just <i>module type</i>.</li>

<li>generally replace 'are called' 'abc is called' with 'are termed', 'abc is termed'</li>

<li>Add to blog: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>around descriptrion of  sections:
 class MyClass primaryFactorySignature = 
 (|instanceSlots| 
  primaryFactoryCode
 ) 
 (innerClassesCode
  instanceMethodsCode
 ) :  
 (classMethodCode
 )
clarify that the first section is definition of primary factory! Technically, the class line in IDE is Primary factory, NOT class</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Check where in code the class names  ampleforthDocumentBody, and ampleforthDocumentClass and self_ampleforth are used.</li>
<li>Figure out how servable.zip is built.</li>
